abstract = {Various hippocampal and neocortical synapses of mammalian brain show both short-term plasticity and long-term plasticity, which are considered to underlie learning and memory by the brain. According to Hebb's postulate, synaptic plasticity encodes memory traces of past experiences into cell assemblies in cortical circuits. However, it remains unclear how the various forms of long-term and short-term synaptic plasticity cooperatively create and reorganize such cell assemblies. Here, we investigate the mechanism in which the three forms of synaptic plasticity known in cortical circuits, i.e., spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term depression (STD) and homeostatic plasticity, cooperatively generate, retain and reorganize cell assemblies in a recurrent neuronal network model. We show that multiple cell assemblies generated by external stimuli can survive noisy spontaneous network activity for an adequate range of the strength of STD. Furthermore, our model predicts that a symmetric temporal window of STDP, such as observed in dopaminergic modulations on hippocampal neurons, is crucial for the retention and integration of multiple cell assemblies. These results may have implications for the understanding of cortical memory processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Hiratani, Fukai.},

abstract = {Event-related brain potentials were recorded from healthy human subjects while they attended to one of two auditory stimulus channels (defined by location, left and right of a fixation point, and pitch) in order to detect rare target events. The distracting properties of periodic noise (vs. continuous noise, experiment 1) and backward speech (vs. forward speech, experiment 2) presented from a third speaker located behind the subjects were investigated. A typical attention effect with a larger negativity for attended tones was observed in both experiments. Backward speech led to a significantly reduced target detection rate for the first four stimuli after onset of the distractor accompanied by a reduced event-related brain potential (ERP)-attention effect and a reduced fronto-central N2b component for the target stimuli. This indicates that irrelevant information leads to an attention decrement of about 1 s duration.},

abstract = {The typical speech of (fluent) bilinguals in monolingual settings contains few switches into the non-target language. Apparently, bilinguals can control what language they output. This article discusses views on how bilinguals exert control over their two languages in monolingual tasks, where participants only have to implicate one of their languages in performing the task, and in translation and, especially, simultaneous interpreting, tasks that can only be performed if both languages are addressed. A distinction is made between " global " control, where control involves the activation and/or inhibition of complete language systems, and " local " control, where control impacts on a restricted set of memory representations. A number of studies suggest that bilingual control is a special case of the control of action in general. This insight suggests an opportunity to incorporate relevant work in the field of translation studies in the study of bilingual control, embedding it in the same theoretical framework. During the past 25 years the study of bilingualism from a cognitive point of view has drawn the attention of an increasingly larger number of researchers. One of the reasons for this increased interest is a growing awareness that bilinguals may process language differently from monolinguals. The canonical models of language processing have been based on the study of monolingual language users or on studying bilingual or multilingual language users from a monolingual point of view. In the latter type of studies the fact that the participants have a command over more than one language is simply ignored. The models of language processing that emerged from these research efforts may be incomplete or, worse, flawed. The study of bilingualism helps to identify such caveats and flaws, thus contributing to a fuller understanding of human language processing. A common approach in studying bilingualism is testing the bilingual participants in monolingual tasks, that is, in tasks in which the participants, IN THEORY, only have to tap into one of their two language systems, such as picture naming in their L1 or lexical decision in their L2. According to this definition, studies that use tasks in which the participants speak in one language while to-be-ignored distractors in the other language are presented may also be regarded monolingual tasks. Stretching the definition of a monolingual task somewhat further, even language-switching tasks, where participants have to produce a response in L1 on some trials and in L2 on other trials, might be regarded monolingual tasks: responding ON EVERY INDIVIDUAL TRIAL only requires the involvement of one of the two language systems. An interesting question is whether and when the other language system},

abstract = {Seeber (2011) recently introduced a series of analytical cognitive load models, providing a detailed illustration of conjectured cognitive resource allocation during simultaneous interpreting. In this article, the authors set out to compare these models with data gathered in an experiment using task-evoked pupillary responses to measure online cognitive load during simultaneous interpreting when embedded in single-sentence context and discourse context. Verb-final and verb-initial constructions were analysed in terms of the load they cause to an inherently capacity-limited system when interpreted simultaneously into a verb-initial language like English. The results show larger pupil dilation with verb-final than with verb-initial constructions, suggesting higher cognitive load with asymmetrical structures. A tendency for reduced cognitive load in the discourse context compared to the sentence context was also found. These data support the models' prediction of an increase in cognitive load towards (and beyond) the end of verb-final constructions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Although the resting and baseline states of the human electroencephalogram and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) are dominated by oscillations in the alpha band (approximately 10 Hz), the functional role of these oscillations remains unclear. In this study we used MEG to investigate how spontaneous oscillations in humans presented before visual stimuli modulate visual perception. Subjects had to report if there was a subtle difference in gray levels between two superimposed presented discs. We then compared the prestimulus brain activity for correctly (hits) versus incorrectly (misses) identified stimuli. We found that visual discrimination ability decreased with an increase in prestimulus alpha power. Given that reaction times did not vary systematically with prestimulus alpha power changes in vigilance are not likely to explain the change in discrimination ability. Source reconstruction using spatial filters allowed us to identify the brain areas accounting for this effect. The dominant sources modulating visual perception were localized around the parieto-occipital sulcus. We suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha power reflects functional inhibition imposed by higher level areas, which serves to modulate the gain of the visual stream.},

abstract = {The negotiation of social order is intimately connected to the capacity to infer and track status relationships. Despite the foundational role of status in social cognition, we know little about how the brain constructs status from social interactions that display it. Although emerging cognitive neuroscience reveals that status judgments depend on the intraparietal sulcus, a brain region that supports the comparison of targets along a quantitative continuum, we present evidence that status judgments do not necessarily reduce to ranking targets along a quantitative continuum. The process of judging status also fits a social interdependence analysis. Consistent with third-party perceivers judging status by inferring whose goals are dictating the terms of the interaction and who is subordinating their desires to whom, status judgments were associated with increased recruitment of medial pFC and STS, brain regions implicated in mental state inference},

abstract = {We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging to guide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalographic recordings in humans, we perturbed PFC function at the inferior frontal junction in participants before they performed a selective-attention, delayed-recognition task. This resulted in diminished top-down modulation of activity in posterior cortex during early encoding stages, which predicted a subsequent decrement in working memory accuracy. Participants with stronger fronto-posterior functional connectivity displayed greater disruptive effects. Our data further suggests that broad alpha-band (7-14 Hz) phase coherence subserved this long-distance top-down modulation. These results suggest that top-down modulation mediated by the prefrontal cortex is a causal link between early attentional processes and subsequent memory performance.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) from normal individuals have played an increasingly important role in our understanding of the mechanisms of attention. This article reviews some of the recent ERP studies of attention, focusing on studies that isolate the operation of attention in specific cognitive subsystems such as perception, working memory, and response selection. Several conclusions are drawn. First, under some conditions attention modulates the initial feedforward volley of neural activity in intermediate visual processing areas. Second, these early effects can be observed for both the voluntary allocation of attention and for the automatic capture of attention following a peripheral visual transient. Third, these effects are present not only when attention is directed to a location in 2-dimensional space, but also when attention is directed to one of two spatially overlapping surfaces. Fourth, attention does not modulate sensory activity unless sensory systems are overloaded; when sensory systems are not taxed, attention may instead operate to influence memory or response processes. That is, attention operates to mitigate information overload in whichever cognitive subsystems are overloaded by a particular combination of stimuli and task.

abstract = {Human brain functions involved in selective attention to particular sounds have been studied extensively with non-invasive measurements of electro-magnetic and hemodynamic brain activity. Here we review studies indicating that selection of the attended sounds for further processing occurs in the auditory cortex. The exact locus of this selection process in the auditory cortex appears to depend on the auditory attribute, i.e., location or pitch, separating the attended sounds from the irrelevant ones. Recent neuroimaging studies extend this finding from processing of non-speech sounds to attentional selection of relevant speech differing by its location or speaker identity from concurrent irrelevant speech. These studies suggest also that selective listening to speech depends less on prefrontal control functions than other kinds of listening tasks demanding selective attention.},

abstract = {In rodents, the progression of extrastriate areas located laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) has been assigned to a putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Recently, we found functional support for such attribution (Tafazoli et al., 2017), by showing that this cortical progression is specialized for coding object identity despite view changes, the hallmark property of a ventral-like pathway. Here, we sought to clarify what computations are at the base of such specialization. To this aim, we performed multi-electrode recordings from V1 and laterolateral area LL (located at the apex of the ventral-like hierarchy) of male rats, during the presentation of drifting gratings and noise movies. We found that the extent to which neuronal responses were entrained to the phase of the gratings sharply dropped from V1 to LL, along with the quality of the receptive fields inferred through reverse correlation. Concomitantly, the tendency of neurons to respond to different oriented gratings increased, while the sharpness of orientation tuning declined. Critically, these trends are consistent with the nonlinear summation of visual inputs that is expected to take place along the ventral stream, according to the predictions of a hierarchical model of ventral computations and a meta-analysis of the monkey literature. This suggests an intriguing homology between the mechanisms responsible for building up shape selectivity and transformation tolerance in the visual cortex of primates and rodents, reasserting the potential of the latter as models to investigate ventral stream functions at the circuitry level.},

abstract = {Face perception, perhaps the most highly developed visual skill in humans, is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that is comprised of multiple, bilateral regions. We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.},

Young adults performed more accurately, albeit not significantly so. P1 latency was shorter in young adults and correlated negatively with task accuracy (with age partialed out). These data support proposals that P1 indexes attentional suppression, which is less efficient in older adults. N1 was larger in older adults but did not correlate with accuracy. Young adults had higher P2 amplitudes and P2 latency correlated with accuracy (age partialed), supporting the view that semantic operations during encoding are affected by aging. These data indicate that attention (P1) and encoding (P2) decrements may contribute to memory or related cognitive decrements in aging, and P1 and P2 latency measures from appropriate paradigms may be salient ERP markers of these decrements.},

While many DERs annotated to non-exonic sequence (41.1{\%}), most were similarly regulated in cytosolic mRNA extracted from independent samples. The DERs were developmentally conserved across 16 brain regions and in the developing mouse cortex, and were expressed in diverse cell and tissue types. The DERs were further enriched for active chromatin marks and clinical risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Lastly, we demonstrate quantitatively that these DERs associate with a changing neuronal phenotype related to differentiation and maturation.

For example, equally salient stimuli associated with reward can capture attention, even when this contradicts current selection goals. Thus, although 'top-down' sources of bias are sometimes defined as those that are not due to physical salience, this conception conflates distinct - and sometimes contradictory - sources of selection bias. We describe an alternative framework, in which past selection history is integrated with current goals and physical salience to shape an integrated priority map. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

An important unsettled issue is whether this improvement is due to a reduction in noise (internal or external), a change in decisional criteria, or signal enhancement. Here we show that attention can affect performance by signal enhancement. For a texture segregation task in which performance is actually diminished when spatial resolution is too high, we observed that attention improved performance at peripheral locations where spatial resolution was too low, but impaired performance at central locations where spatial resolution was too high. The counterintuitive impairment of performance that we found at the central retinal locations appears to have only one possible explanation: attention enhances spatial resolution.},

abstract = {Multivariate pattern analysis is a technique that allows the decoding of conceptual information such as the semantic category of a perceived object from neuroimaging data. Impressive single-trial classification results have been reported in studies that used fMRI. Here, we investigate the possibility to identify conceptual representations from event-related EEG based on the presentation of an object in different modalities: its spoken name, its visual representation and its written name. We used Bayesian logistic regression with a multivariate Laplace prior for classification. Marked differences in classification performance were observed for the tested modalities. Highest accuracies (89{\%} correctly classified trials) were attained when classifying object drawings. In auditory and orthographical modalities, results were lower though still significant for some subjects. The employed classification method allowed for a precise temporal localization of the features that contributed to the performance of the classifier for three modalities. These findings could help to further understand the mechanisms underlying conceptual representations. The study also provides a first step towards the use of concept decoding in the context of real-time brain-computer interface applications.},

After completing compulsory education at age 16, students in England can choose to continue to study for two years (A-levels) in preparation for applying to university and they can freely choose which subjects to study. Here, for the first time, we show that choosing to do A-levels and the choice of subjects show substantial genetic influence, as does performance after two years studying the chosen subjects. Using a UK-representative sample of 6584 twin pairs, heritability estimates were 44{\%} for choosing to do A-levels and 52–80{\%} for choice of subject. Achievement after two years was also highly heritable (35–76{\%}). The findings that DNA differences substantially affect differences in appetites as well as aptitudes suggest a genetic way of thinking about education in which individuals actively create their own educational experiences in part based on their genetic propensities.},

abstract = {Spoken language (unimodal) interpreters often prefer to interpret from their non-dominant language (L2) into their native language (L1). Anecdotally, signed language (bimodal) interpreters express the opposite bias, preferring to interpret from L1 (spoken language) into L2 (signed language). We conducted a large survey study (N=1,359) of both unimodal and bimodal interpreters that confirmed these preferences. The L1 to L2 direction preference was stronger for novice than expert bimodal interpreters, while novice and expert unimodal interpreters did not differ from each other. The results indicated that the different direction preferences for bimodal and unimodal interpreters cannot be explained by language production-comprehension asymmetries or by work or training experiences. We suggest that modality and language-specific features of signed languages drive the directionality preferences of bimodal interpreters. Specifically, we propose that fingerspelling, transcoding (literal word-for-word translation), self-monitoring, and consumers' linguistic variation influence the preference of bimodal interpreters for working into their L2.},

How do the linguistic characteristics of the language to be interpreted influence synchronicity? And in what is the interpreter's strategy for achieving synchronicity in interpretation from Korean to other languages? To answer these questions, EVS measurements of Korean-Japanese and Korean-Chinese interpretation materials were analyzed. The results showed that in Korean-Chinese interpretation the interpreter begins the interpretation before a whole sentence is finished, and that in Korean-Japanese interpretation, the interpreter leaves a time lag before beginning the interpreted utterance. This study indicated that the information processing in simultaneous interpretation is not carried out through the characteristics of the language itself but the interpreter's guessing based on unit of meaning and strategies accumulated by the interpreter through long experience.},

abstract = {This article offers a general overview of a wider experimental research project on simultaneous interpretation (SI). Contrary to previous assumptions, the results suggest that when working from English to Spanish, both lexical and syntactical forms, as well as automaticity, play a more than substantial role in the choices made by interpreters, rather than being systematically dictated by the underlying meaning of the original utterances. The experimental data appear to corroborate several intuitions already put forward by other researchers, further allowing for the identification of a series of highly specific and previously unknown interpreters' strategies, as well as flows of interferences. These results led to the formulation of a tentative model of information processing during SI, suggesting the concurrent interplay of three complementary and overlapping systems: literalness, automatic responses and meaning construction. This new proposal is not without consequences for many of the pillars of the profession, by re-opening the debate surrounding aspects such as language specificity and directionality, literalness, issues related to interpreting to or from one's first language, etc. This proposal may therefore have implications for interpreter training and for the future developments of the profession.

The results show that interpreters both listened and spoke for 61{\%} of the total words uttered by speakers and 40{\%} of total utterance time. The accuracy of the listening and speaking portion was found to be statistically poorer than that of the listening only portion. When the speakers speech proportion increased, accuracy decreased due to reduced speaker pauses within the interpreters speaking portion. As a whole, time simultaneity ratio and accuracy showed a negative correlation. However, the interpreter who increased speech proportion coupled with time simultaneity ratio showed better accuracy than the other when two interpreters worked on the same speech.},

abstract = {In a dichotic listening situation stimuli were presented one at a time and at random to either ear of the subject at constant inter-stimulus intervals of 800 msec. The subject's task was to detect and count occasional slightly different stimuli in one ear. In Experiment 1, these 'signal' stimuli were slightly louder, and in Experiment 2 they had a slightly higher pitch, than the much more frequent, 'standard', stimuli. In both experiments signals occured randomly at either ear. Separate evoked potentials from three different locations were recorded for each of the four kinds of stimuli (attended signals, unattended signals, attended standards, unattended standards). Contrary to Hillyard et al. (1973), no early (N1 component) evoked-potential enhancement was observed to stimuli to the attended ear as compared with those to the unattended ear, but there was a later negative shift superimposed on potentials elicited by the former stimuli. This negative shift was considered identical to the N1 enhancement of Hillyard and his colleagues which in the present study was forced, by the longer inter-stimulus interval used, to demonstrate temporal dissociation with the N1 component. The 'Hillyard effect' was, consequently, explained as being caused by a superimposition of a CNV kind of negative shift on the evoked potential to the attended stimuli rather than by a growth of the 'real' N1 component of the evoked potential. ?? 1978.},

abstract = {All natural cognitive systems, and, in particular, our own, gradually forget previously learned information. Plausible models of human cognition should therefore exhibit similar patterns of gradual forgetting of old information as new information is acquired. Only rarely does new learning in natural cognitive systems completely disrupt or erase previously learned information; that is, natural cognitive systems do not, in general, forget 'catastrophically'. Unfortunately, though, catastrophic forgetting does occur under certain circumstances in distributed connectionist networks. The very features that give these networks their remarkable abilities to generalize, to function in presence of degraded input, and so on, are found to be the root cause of catastrophic forgetting. The challenge in this field is to discover how to keep the advantages of distributed connectionist networks while avoiding the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this article the causes, consequences and numerous solutions to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks are examined. The review will consider how the brain might have overcome this problem and will also explore the consequences of this solution for distributed connectionist networks.},

This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species.

First published October 5, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00297.2011.-The cortical representation of the acoustic features of continuous speech is the foundation of speech perception. In this study, noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings are obtained from human subjects actively listening to spoken narratives, in both simple and cocktail party-like auditory scenes. By modeling how acoustic features of speech are encoded in ongoing MEG activity as a spectrotemporal response function, we demonstrate that the slow temporal modulations of speech in a broad spectral region are represented bilaterally in auditory cortex by a phase-locked temporal code. For speech presented monaurally to either ear, this phase-locked response is always more faithful in the right hemisphere, but with a shorter latency in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. When different spoken narratives are presented to each ear simultaneously (dichotic listening), the resulting cortical neural activity precisely encodes the acoustic features of both of the spoken narratives, but slightly weakened and delayed compared with the monaural response. Critically, the early sensory response to the attended speech is considerably stronger than that to the unattended speech, demonstrating top-down attentional gain control. This attentional gain is substantial even during the subjects' very first exposure to the speech mixture and therefore largely independent of knowledge of the speech content. Together, these findings characterize how the spectrotemporal features of speech are encoded in human auditory cortex and establish a single-trial-based paradigm to study the neural basis underlying the cocktail party phenomenon.},

Experimental data in healthy subjects extend the cerebellar role to learning, emotional and mood control. The need for a non-invasive tool to influence cerebellar function in normal and pathological conditions led researchers to develop transcranial cerebellar direct current stimulation (tcDCS). tcDCS, like tDCS, depends on the principle that weak direct currents delivered at around 2. mA for minutes over the cerebellum through surface electrodes induce prolonged changes in cerebellar function. tcDCS modulates several cerebellar skills in humans including motor control, learning and emotional processing. tcDCS also influences the cerebello-brain interactions induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), walking adaptation, working memory and emotional recognition. Hence tcDCS is a simple physiological tool that can improve our physiological understanding of the human cerebellum, and should prove useful also in patients with cerebellar dysfunction or psychiatric disorders and those undergoing neurorehabilitation to enhance neuroplasticity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {According to working memory theory (e.g., Baddeley, 1990), bilingual digit span is mediated by a variation in speech rate between the languages. This view is supported by findings that demonstrate the elimination of the bilingual digit span effect under concurrent articulation. The present study addressed the question as to how experienced simultaneous interpreters, experts in processing information whilst articulating a translation in a target language, cope with the deleterious effects of articulatory. suppression. Bilingual digit span with and without articulatory suppression was compared between experienced simultaneous interpreters fluent in Finnish and English and a control group consisting of Finnish undergraduates majoring in English. The results showed that articulatory suppression occasioned a decrement in digit span for both groups. Articulatory suppression eliminated the bilingual digit span effect for controls, whereas the language difference was preserved for the simultaneous interpreters. The present findings highlighted the potential for further research that examines memory performance by simultaneous interpreters under secondary task loadings as a means of extending current models of human information processing.},

abstract = {The central executive component of working memory is a poorly specified and very powerful system that could be criticized as little more than a homunculus. A research strategy is outlined that attempts to specify and analyse its component functions and is illustrated with four lines of research. The first concerns the study of the capacity to coordinate performance on two separate tasks. A second involves the capacity to switch retrieval strategies as reflected in random generation. The capacity to attend selectively to one stimulus and inhibit the disrupting effect of others comprises the third line of research, and the fourth involves the capacity to hold and manipulate information in long-term memory, as reflected in measures of working memory span. It is suggested that this multifaceted approach is a fruitful one that leaves open the question of whether it will ultimately prove more appropriate to regard the executive as a unified system with multiple functions, or simply as an agglomeration of independent though interacting control processes. In the meantime, it seems useful to continue to use the concept of a central executive as a reminder of the crucially important control functions of working memory. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This document describes the MD5 message-digest algorithm. The algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit fingerprint or message digest of the input. It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any message having a given prespecified target message digest. The MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a large file must be compressed in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. The MD5 algorithm is designed to be quite fast on 32-bit machines. In addition, the MD5 algorithm does not require any large substitution tables; the algorithm can be coded quite compactly. The MD5 algorithm is an extension of the MD4 message-digest algorithm. MD5 is slightly slower than MD4, but is more conservative in design. MD5 was designed because it was felt that MD4 was perhaps being adopted for use more quickly than justified by the existing critical review; because MD4 was designed to be exceptionally fast, it is at the edge in terms of risking successful cryptanalytic attack. MD5 backs off a bit, giving up a little in speed for a much greater likelihood of ultimate security. It incorporates some suggestions made by various reviewers, and contains additional optimizations. The MD5 algorithm is being placed in the public domain for review and possible adoption as a standard.},

abstract = {Intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations play a crucial role in the physiological interaction between Ca 2+ channels and Ca 2+-activated K + channels. The commonly used model, a Ca 2+ pool with a short relaxation time, fails to simulate interactions occurring at multiple time scales. On the other hand, detailed computational models including various Ca 2+ buffers and pumps can result in large computational cost due to radial diffusion in large compartments, which may be undesirable when simulating morphologically detailed Purkinje cell models. We present a method using a compensating mechanism to replace radial diffusion and compared the dynamics of different Ca 2+ buffering models during generation of a dendritic Ca 2+ spike in a single compartment model of a PC dendritic segment with Ca 2+ channels of P- and T-type and Ca 2+ -activated K + channels of BK- and SK-type. The Ca 2+ dynamics models used are (1) a single Ca 2+ pool; (2) two Ca 2+ pools, respectively, for the fast and slow transients; (3) detailed Ca 2+ dynamics with buffers, pump, and diffusion; and (4) detailed Ca 2+ dynamics with buffers, pump, and diffusion compensation. Our results show that detailed Ca 2+ dynamics models have significantly better control over Ca 2+-activated K + channels and lead to physiologically more realistic simulations of Ca 2+ spikes and bursting. Furthermore, the compensating mechanism largely eliminates the effect of removing diffusion from the model on Ca 2+ dynamics over multiple time scales. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.

Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent research on the effect of selective attention on the N1 component of the evoked potential is reviewed. These studies are based on the finding of Hillyard, Hink, Schwent and Picton (1973) that this component is selectively enhanced in response to attended stimuli when a very rapid rate of stimulus delivery is used. On the basis of the subsequent set of experiments, the conditions and limits of the existence of the auditory 'N1 effect' are now quite clear. Moreover, this finding has been extended to somatosensory and visual modalities. In the present review a detailed examination of these studies has suggested a re-interpretation of the N1 effect. According to this reinterpretation, it is not a 'true' N1 component which is enhanced but the effect is produced by a summation of a negative shift with the evoked-potential wave form. Under some conditions such as those involving a very fast rate of stimulus delivery, this effect commences very early, making the N1 component appear larger. It is suggested that this shift reflects orienting to, and further processing of, an input found relevant in a preliminary sensory analysis. Topographical evidence for this kind of interpretation is provided by several studies. This negative shift is, hence, associated with voluntary attention. Some of the reviewed studies have described a rather similar negative shift as a correlate of involuntary attention to rare stimuli among the much more frequent, 'standard', stimuli.},

abstract = {We describe the use of random field and permutation methods to detect activation in cortically constrained maps of current density computed from MEG data. The methods are applicable to any inverse imaging method that maps event-related MEG to a coregistered cortical surface. These approaches also extend directly to images computed from event-related EEG data. We determine statistical thresholds that control the familywise error rate (FWER) across space or across both space and time. Both random field and permutation methods use the distribution of the maximum statistic under the null hypothesis to find FWER thresholds. The former methods make assumptions on the distribution and smoothness of the data and use approximate analytical solutions, the latter resample the data and rely on empirical distributions. Both methods account for spatial and temporal correlation in the cortical maps. Unlike previous nonparametric work in neuroimaging, we address the problem of nonuniform specificity that can arise without a Gaussianity assumption. We compare and evaluate the methods on simulated data and experimental data from a somatosensory-evoked response study. We find that the random field methods are conservative with or without smoothing, though with a 5 vertex FWHM smoothness, they are close to exact. Our permutation methods demonstrated exact specificity in simulation studies. In real data, the permutation method was not as sensitive as the RF method, although this could be due to violations of the random field theory assumptions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Theta tACS was applied to the left parietal and left frontal brain areas of healthy participants after which resting electroencephalogram (EEG) data was recorded. Following sham/active stimulation, the participants solved two tests of fluid intelligence while their EEG was recorded. The results showed that active theta tACS affected spectral power in theta and alpha frequency bands. In addition, active theta tACS improved performance on tests of fluid intelligence. This influence was more pronounced in the group of participants that received stimulation to the left parietal area than in the group of participants that received stimulation to the left frontal area. Left parietal tACS increased performance on the difficult test items of both tests (RAPM and PF{\&}C) whereas left frontal tACS increased performance only on the easy test items of one test (RAPM). The observed behavioral tACS influences were also accompanied by changes in neuroelectric activity. The behavioral and neuroelectric data tentatively support the P-FIT neurobiological model of intelligence. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Goal: We present and evaluate a wearable high-density dry-electrode EEG system and an open-source software framework for online neuroimaging and state classification. Methods: The system integrates a 64-channel dry EEG form factor with wireless data streaming for online analysis. A real-time software framework is applied, including adaptive artifact rejection, cortical source localization, multivariate effective connectivity inference, data visualization, and cognitive state classification from connectivity features using a constrained logistic regression approach (ProxConn). We evaluate the system identification methods on simulated 64-channel EEG data. Then, we evaluate system performance, using ProxConn and a benchmark ERP method, in classifying response errors in nine subjects using the dry EEG system. Results: Simulations yielded high accuracy (AUC = 0.97 ± 0.021) for real-time cortical connectivity estimation. Response error classification using cortical effective connectivity [short-time directdirected transfer function (sdDTF)] was significantly above chance with similar performance (AUC) for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.09) and LCMV (0.72 ± 0.08) source localization. Cortical ERPbased classification was equivalent to ProxConn for cLORETA (0.74 ± 0.16) butsignificantlybetterforLCMV (0.82 ± 0.12). Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility for real-time cortical connectivity analysis and cognitive state classification from highdensity wearable dry EEG. Significance: This paper is the first validated application of these methods to 64-channel dry EEG. This study addresses a need for robust real-time measurement and interpretation of complex brain activity in the dynamic environment of the wearable setting. Such advances can have broad impact in research, medicine, and brain-computer interfaces. The pipelines are made freely available in the open-source SIFT and BCILAB toolboxes.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

We begin by encoding information about the basic structure of the natural world and continue to assimilate information about specific patterns with which we become familiar. The specificity of the learning suggests that all areas of the cerebral cortex are plastic and can represent various aspects of learned information. The neural substrate of perceptual learning relates to the nature of the neural code itself, including changes in cortical maps, in the temporal characteristics of neuronal responses, and in modulation of contextual influences. Top-down control of these representations suggests that learning involves an interaction between multiple cortical areas.},

abstract = {Simultaneous interpretation—the continuous, immediate, oral translation from one language to another—permits researchers to consider bilingual processing in real-life professional situations. The task is physically and cognitively demanding, taking years to master. Most professional interpreters receive considerable graduate-level training following a rigorous selection process which requires expertise in three or more languages and skills in a range of other cognitive abilities. Working memory—the ability to store and process incoming information verbatim for a brief period—has been posited as a cognitive skill heavily called upon throughout the simultaneous interpretation process. Since the brain's structure and function are influenced by experience, and working memory is considered crucial to interpretation, it has been postulated that simultaneous interpreters may have better working memory skills than non-interpreters. The evidence in the literature has been contradictory, however. A number of studies indicate superior working memory for interpreters relative to non-interpreters, while others do not. This chapter weighs the data in support of working memory advantages for interpreters against that suggesting no difference between the two groups, concluding that the strength of the arguments favors greater working memory skills in interpreters.

abstract = {Working memory (WM) plays a crucial role in learning a second language (L2). The ability to repeat words in an unknown language has been observed to predict success in learning that language. Conversely, decreased digit span and inability to repeat pseudowords have been related with failure in L2 acquisition. Not only digit span, but also "word span" and "semantic span" should be considered in WM analysis. In addition to the phonological system, a semantic system is proposed in the WM model for language. In bilinguals, brain activation patterns during WM tasks have been observed to be more complex when using a L2. Processing information in L2 is more demanding, and WM may be less efficient. It can be conjectured that language understanding defects in L2 are at least partially due to this decreased efficiency of WM in its phonological as well as in its semantic subsystem. Learning outcomes: The reader will be introduced to the basic assumptions of WM. It will be emphasized that WM is significantly involved in the ability to learn a L2. Cross-linguistic differences in digit span will be analyzed. It will be concluded that despite digit span and word span are affected by different variables, "semantic span" may be similar across languages. Words in a L2 function as low frequency words, and hence, semantic search takes longer and WM is less efficient. It will be concluded that in addition to the "phonological system," the WM model should include a "semantic system," involving a "semantic store" and a "semantic search" process. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Models of cellular molecular systems are built from components such as biochemical reactions (including interactions between ligands and membrane-bound proteins), conformational changes and active and passive transport. A discrete, stochastic description of the kinetics is often essential to capture the behavior of the system accurately. Where spatial effects play a prominent role the complex morphology of cells may have to be represented, along with aspects such as chemical localization and diffusion. This high level of detail makes efficiency a particularly important consideration for software that is designed to simulate such systems. RESULTS We describe STEPS, a stochastic reaction-diffusion simulator developed with an emphasis on simulating biochemical signaling pathways accurately and efficiently. STEPS supports all the above-mentioned features, and well-validated support for SBML allows many existing biochemical models to be imported reliably. Complex boundaries can be represented accurately in externally generated 3D tetrahedral meshes imported by STEPS. The powerful Python interface facilitates model construction and simulation control. STEPS implements the composition and rejection method, a variation of the Gillespie SSA, supporting diffusion between tetrahedral elements within an efficient search and update engine. Additional support for well-mixed conditions and for deterministic model solution is implemented. Solver accuracy is confirmed with an original and extensive validation set consisting of isolated reaction, diffusion and reaction-diffusion systems. Accuracy imposes upper and lower limits on tetrahedron sizes, which are described in detail. By comparing to Smoldyn, we show how the voxel-based approach in STEPS is often faster than particle-based methods, with increasing advantage in larger systems, and by comparing to MesoRD we show the efficiency of the STEPS implementation. CONCLUSION STEPS simulates models of cellular reaction-diffusion systems with complex boundaries with high accuracy and high performance in C/C++, controlled by a powerful and user-friendly Python interface. STEPS is free for use and is available at http://steps.sourceforge.net/},

abstract = {Recall from visual memory is vulnerable to the influence of task-irrelevant information, including the remembered, prototypical value of stimuli seen previously. Wilken and Ma (2004) proposed that this distortion of recall was actually adaptive, with the task-irrelevant information compensating for imperfections of memory. We tested their proposal by using trial-by-trial oscillations in the electroencephalogram's alpha band (8-14 Hz) collected from human subjects as a marker for the strength of visual attention. Subjects' recall of stimulus spatial frequency showed a systematic error, namely a shift toward the prototypical value of previously seen stimuli. The magnitude of this prototype effect was strongly related to the amplitude of alpha band oscillations recorded at posterior sensor locations during the first 100 ms after stimulus onset. Our results support the hypothesis that the prototype effect is compensatory for imprecision in memory. Moreover, the attentional modulation of alpha activity during the encoding of the target stimulus is consistent with the view that attention sharpens the neural responses that are elicited by the task-relevant stimulus.},

abstract = {Here we review the usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in modulating cortical networks in ways that might produce performance enhancements in healthy human subjects. To date over sixty studies have reported significant improvements in speed and accuracy in a variety of tasks involving perceptual, motor, and executive processing. Two basic categories of enhancement mechanisms are suggested by this literature: direct modulation of a cortical region or network that leads to more efficient processing, and addition-by-subtraction, which is disruption of processing which competes or distracts from task performance. Potential applications of TMS cognitive enhancement, including research into cortical function, rehabilitation therapy in neurological and psychiatric illness, and accelerated skill acquisition in healthy individuals are discussed, as are methods of optimizing the magnitude and duration of TMS-induced performance enhancement, such as improvement of targeting through further integration of brain imaging with TMS. One technique, combining multiple sessions of TMS with concurrent TMS/task performance to induce Hebbian-like learning, appears to be promising for prolonging enhancement effects. While further refinements in the application of TMS to cognitive enhancement can still be made, and questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the observed effects, this appears to be a fruitful area of investigation that may shed light on the basic mechanisms of cognitive function and their therapeutic modulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We use a combination of two different approaches for linear ICA: Comon's information theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast functions for ICA. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple fixed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions},

@article{Pratt2011,
abstract = {Working memory and attention interact in a way that enables us to focus on relevant items and maintain current goals. The influence of working memory on attention has been noted in several studies using dual task designs. Multitasking increases the demands on working memory and reduces the amount of resources available for cognitive control functions such as resolving stimulus conflict. However, few studies have investigated the temporal activation of the cortex while multitasking. The present study addresses the extent to which working memory load influences early (P1) and late (P300) attention-sensitive event-related potential components using a dual task paradigm. Participants performed an arrow flanker task alone (single task condition) or concurrently with a Sternberg memory task (dual task condition). In the flanker task, participants responded to the direction of a central arrow surrounded by congruent or incongruent arrows. In the dual task condition, participants were presented with a Sternberg task that consisted of either four or seven consonants to remember prior to a short block of flanker trials. Participants were slower and less accurate on incongruent versus congruent trials. Furthermore, accuracy on incongruent trials was reduced in both dual task conditions. Likewise, P300 amplitude to incongruent flanker stimuli decreased when working memory load increased. These findings suggest that interference from incongruent flankers was more difficult to suppress when working memory was taxed. In addition, P1 amplitude was diminished on all flanker trials in the dual task condition. This result indicates that top-down attentional control over early visual processing is diminished by increasing demands on working memory. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological results suggest that working memory is critical in maintaining attentional focus and resolving conflict.},

Radvansky et al. and that there is no evidence for concept suppression in a new fan experiment. The ACT-R model provides good quantitative fits to the results, as shown in a variety of experiments. The 3 key concepts in these fits are (a) the associative strength between 2 concepts reflects the degree to which one concept predicts the other; (b) foils ar rejected by retrieving mismatching facts; and (c) participants can adjust the relative weights they give to various cues in retrieval.},

Women's exploratory behavior gives rise to a notion of a secure base warranting a sense of safety while men's behavior does not appear to be influenced by risk.

abstract = {How humans solve the cocktail party problem remains unknown. However, progress has been made recently thanks to the realization that cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of speech. This has led to the development of regression methods for studying the neurophysiology of continuous speech. One such method, known as stimulus-reconstruction, has been successfully utilized with cortical surface recordings and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the former is invasive and gives a relatively restricted view of processing along the auditory hierarchy, whereas the latter is expensive and rare. Thus it would be extremely useful for research in many populations if stimulus-reconstruction was effective using electroencephalography (EEG), a widely available and inexpensive technology. Here we show that single-trial (≈60 s) unaveraged EEG data can be decoded to determine attentional selection in a naturalistic multispeaker environment. Furthermore, we show a significant correlation between our EEG-based measure of attention and performance on a high-level attention task. In addition, by attempting to decode attention at individual latencies, we identify neural processing at ∼200 ms as being critical for solving the cocktail party problem. These findings open up new avenues for studying the ongoing dynamics of cognition using EEG and for developing effective and natural brain-computer interfaces.},

Results showed that positive mood led to significantly poorer creative problem-solving performance. No link was found between negative mood and general arousal. Performance on the contrasting analytic problem-solving tasks was negatively related to anxiety, but not to positive or negative mood states. In Study 2, the procedure was followed with the addition of experimentally induced mood states. The results obtained in Study 1 for mood ratings were replicated. In the induced mood conditions, negative mood signi{\textregistered} cantly facilitated creative problem- solving performance relative to induced neutral mood, which in turn was better than the control condition.

(2) Is there evidence for separate systems for processing of orthographic and phonologic representations of words? Reaction time (RT), N400 amplitude and latency were used to examine the effect of semantic priming on lexical access of auditorily and visually presented nouns and verbs. We found that the temporal patterns of primed RTs and N400 latencies differed for nouns and verbs, indicating a functional difference in processing. However, the absence of topographic differences in N400 between nouns and verbs did not support anatomically distinct representations of these word classes. By contrast, a modality-specific topography at N400, in addition to RT and N400 amplitude differences between auditory and visual conditions, supported the proposed separation of the orthographic and phonologic representations of words. The implications of the findings for general theories of lexical organization are discussed.},

Alpha phase synchronicity is a new measure consisting (for a given stimulus presentation) of the angular or circular variance of the alpha phase at stimulus onset across the parieto-occipital sites. The lower the angular variance, the higher the phase synchronicity (the more closely in phase the alpha activity across these sites) and vice versa. Subaveraged event-related potentials (ERPs) were formed for high and low prestimulus alpha phase synchronicity stimulus presentations. N100 amplitude was significantly greater in the high than the low phase synchronicity subaverages. In addition, RT was significantly reduced in the high prestimulus alpha phase synchronicity cases. Alpha phase synchronicity reflects an aspect of brain state that influences subsequent stimulus processing.},

abstract = {Large Ca2+ signals essential for cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell synapses are known to be induced when PF activation precedes climbing fiber (CF) activation by 50-200 ms, consistent with cerebellar learning theories. However, large Ca2+ signals and/or LTD can also be induced by massive PF stimulation alone or by photolysis of caged Ca2+ or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3). To understand the spike-timing detection mechanisms in cerebellar LTD, we developed a kinetic model of Ca2+ dynamics within a Purkinje dendritic spine. In our kinetic simulation, IP3 was first produced via the metabotropic pathway of PF inputs, and the Ca2+ influx in response to the CF input triggered regenerative Ca2+-induced Ca 2+ release from the internal stores via the IP3 receptors activated by the increased IP3. The delay in IP3 increase caused by the PF metabotropic pathway generated the optimal PF-CF interval. The Ca2+ dynamics revealed a threshold for large Ca2+ release that decreased as IP3 increased, and it coherently explained the different forms of LTD. At 2.5 $\mu$M IP3, CF activation after PF activation was essential to reach the threshold for the regenerative Ca 2+ release. At 10 $\mu$M IP3, the same as achieved experimentally by strong IP3 photolysis, the threshold was lower, and thus large Ca2+ release was generated even without CF stimulation. In contrast, the basal 0.1 $\mu$M IP3 level resulted in an extremely high Ca2+ threshold for regenerative Ca2+ release. Thus, the results demonstrated that Ca2+ dynamics can detect spike timing under physiological conditions, which supports cerebellar learning theories.},

In one condition, subjects discriminated phonetic changes in the VC, CV, or both formant-transition regions. In another condition, they discriminated equally difficult intensity changes in the same VCV regions. Attention-related negative difference waves showed enhanced early and late components (Nd-e and Nd-l) during phoneme-discrimination conditions. Hemispheric asymmetries developed only during the Nd-l and were more pronounced during phoneme discrimination. The results suggest that auditory areas of both hemispheres are specialized for phonetic analysis, with hemispherically specialized mechanisms engaged primarily during the final stages of phoneme processing.

Here, serial section transmission electron microscopy was automated to densely reconstruct four volumes, totaling 670 $\mu$m3, from the rat hippocampus as proving grounds to determine when axo-dendritic proximities predict synapses. First, in contrast with Peters' rule, the density of axons within reach of dendritic spines did not predict synaptic density along dendrites because the fraction of axons making synapses was variable. Second, an axo-dendritic touch did not predict a synapse; nevertheless, the density of synapses along a hippocampal dendrite appeared to be a universal fraction, 0.2, of the density of touches. Finally, the largest touch between an axonal bouton and spine indicated the site of actual synapses with about 80{\%} precision but would miss about half of all synapses. Thus, it will be difficult to predict synaptic connectivity using data sets missing ultrastructural details that distinguish between axo-dendritic touches and bona fide synapses. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Although nonhuman apes have complex repertoires of emotional expression, little is known about the role of affective processes in ape decision-making. To illuminate the evolutionary origins of human-like patterns of choice, we investigated decision-making in humans' closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). In two studies, we examined these species' temporal and risk preferences, and assessed whether apes show emotional and motivational responses in decision-making contexts. We find that (1) chimpanzees are more patient and more risk-prone than are bonobos, (2) both species exhibit affective and motivational responses following the outcomes of their decisions, and (3) some emotional and motivational responses map onto species-level and individual-differences in decision-making. These results indicate that apes do exhibit emotional responses to decision-making, like humans. We explore the hypothesis that affective and motivational biases may underlie the psychological mechanisms supporting value-based preferences in these species.},

In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation.

Language switching resulted in equal switching costs for both languages and was associated with a modulation in the ERP waveforms (time windows 275-375??ms and 375-475??ms). Mixed language context affected especially the L1, both in ERPs and in latencies, which became slower in L1 than L2.

Intesring is the finding that the size of negative set does not matter. However, items with stronger memory traces (e.g. high probability to be presented) give rise to shorter RTs, and this is difficult for the serial exhaustive scanning process. The slope increases if the stimulus is presented in another form than the items in memory (e.g. digits vs digit-words). Moreover, if memory items are from different categories scanning can become more efficient as if sometimes it stops when ghe relevent category has been exhausted. Impressive is that more complex objects (e.g. nonsense syllables) yield a slower scanning rate, and the rate of scanning is inversely proportional to the memory span (i.e. how many of the objects can be remembered).},

abstract = {The aim of the present exploratory correlational study was to test whether a relationship exists between working memory capacity (WMC) and simultaneous interpreting (SI) performance measures in a sample of professional interpreters. Twenty-eight professional interpreters, aged 25-55, were tested on WMC tasks (letter span, Corsi task, complex span) and on several measures of SI (lexical, semantic and syntactic processing, temporal delay, vocabulary richness and dealing with speed). Additionally, general cognitive ability, age and interpreting experience were considered. There are two main findings. First, WMC in this sample shows predictable patterns in the structure of interpreters' working memory: there was a dissociation between verbal and spatial memory and a negative relationship between age on the one hand and WMC and general cognitive ability on the other. This negative relationship goes against the hypothesis of WMC enlargement with interpreting experience. Secondly, WMC measures were only marginally significantly related to SI measures, and then only to those which have a predictable high memory component, such as figures and lists of nouns. The results suggest that WMC, where the focus is on storage and maintenance, may not be as important for professional SI as previously thought.

Here we show that despite their inability to report the orientation of an individual patch, observers can reliably estimate the average orientation, demonstrating that the local orientation signals are combined rather than lost. Our results imply that crowding is distinct from ordinary masking, and is perhaps related to texture perception. Under crowded conditions, the orientation signals in primary visual cortex are pooled before they reach consciousness.},

abstract = {In conference interpretation research, anticipation is usually seen as the oral production of a particular part of a message in special circumstances. In psychophysiological research, however, anticipation is a mental process. The article presents a revised definition of anticipation that takes account of both approaches. It does so in terms of deliberate enrichment, a conceptual tool from relevance theory. Anticipation in conference interpreting is found to yield a high number of strengthenings rather than deletions, additions or contextual implications. This is a cognitive aspect which is typical of interpreting and distinguishes it from other communication events.},

abstract = {Trust pervades human societies. Trust is indispensable in friendship, love, families and organizations, and plays a key role in economic exchange and politics. In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

It briefly reviews the key empirical findings to have emerged from studies of auditory selective attention over the last fifty years or so. It also highlights recent evidence demonstrating the connection between selective attention and working memory. Following this, it reviews a number of the models and theories (both cognitive and neuroscientific) that have been put forward in order to explain how selective attention operates in audition. Finally, it throws light on the fact that the research reviewed in this article suggests that the awareness of the various stimuli in more complex auditory environments is far sparser than the everyday intuitions would lead one to believe. Indeed, the latest research on the phenomenon of auditory change deafness unequivocally shows that in the absence of attention, people simply have no conscious awareness of the majority of the auditory stimuli around them.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar-ial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

abstract = {The contribution of the event-related potential (ERP) research to understanding human selective attention will be evaluated. A closely related issue, the starting point of the present treatment, involves the nature and extent of automaticity in information processing. The mismatch-negativity component of the ERP suggests that the basic, obligatory, processing of the physical features of auditory stimuli is unaffected by the direction of attention. These data also reveal a possible mechanism for attention switching to stimulus change occurring in the unattended input, observed by cognitive psychologists. The N1 wave of the ERP might in turn provide a data base for explaining similar attention switches to stimulus onsets after breaks in stimulation and to offsets of long-duration stimuli. With regard to selective attention, the processing negativity might make it possible to delineate the central principle of stimulus selection in attention, a goal probably inaccessible to non-physiological attention research. In the visual modality, cognitive psychologists have found that spatial attention is more fundamental and powerful in stimulus selection than any other form of visual selective attention. Consistently, ERP data show that the exogenous components in vision are enhanced by spatial selective attention but not when attended and unattended stimuli are not spatially separated. Also, ERP data (the P3 wave) give support to certain forms of resource-allocation theories of attention. In addition, with regard to the currently popular distinction between automatic versus controlled processing, these data strongly suggest that extended consistent-mapping training does not lead to a "genuine" automatization of a search process in the sense of independence of a limited-capacity system. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {We have used UV flash photolysis of DM-nitrophen in combination with model-based analysis of Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-5N fluorescence transients to study the kinetics of Ca2+ binding to calbindin-D(28K). The experiments used saturated DM-nitrophen at a [Ca2+] of 1.5 $\mu$M. Under these conditions, UV laser flashes produced rapid steplike increases in [Ca2+] in the absence of calbindin-D(28K), and in its presence the decay of the flash-induced fluorescence was due solely to the Ca2+ buffering by the protein. We developed a novel method for kinetic parameter derivation and used the synthetic Ca2+ buffer EGTA to confirm its validity. We provide evidence that calbindin-D(28K) binds Ca2+ in at least two distinct kinetic patterns, one arising from high-affinity sites that bind Ca2+ with a k(on) comparable to that of EGTA (i.e., {\~{}}1 x 107 M-1 s-1) and another with lower affinity and an approximately eightfold faster k(on). In view of the inability of conventional approaches to adequately resolve rapid Ca2+ binding kinetics of Ca2+ buffers, this method promises to be highly valuable for studying the Ca2+ binding properties of other biologically important Ca2+ binding proteins.},

abstract = {Spatial component analysis is often used to explore multidimensional time series data whose sources cannot be measured directly. Several methods may be used to decompose the data into a set of spatial components with temporal loadings. Component selection is of crucial importance, and should be supported by objective criteria. In some applications, the use of a well defined component selection criterion may provide for automation of the analysis. In this paper we describe a novel approach for ranking of spatial components calculated from the EEG or MEG data recorded within evoked response paradigm. Our method is called Mutual Information (MI) Spectrum and is based on gauging the amount of MI of spatial component temporal loadings with a synthetically created reference signal. We also describe the appropriate randomization based statistical assessment scheme that can be used for selection of components with statistically significant amount of MI. Using simulated data with realistic trial to trial variations and SNR corresponding to the real recordings we demonstrate the superior performance characteristics of the described MI based measure as compared to a more conventionally used power driven gauge. We also demonstrate the application of the MI Spectrum for the selection of task-related independent components from real MEG data. We show that the MI spectrum allows to identify task-related components reliably in a consistent fashion, yielding stable results even from a small number of trials. We conclude that the proposed method fits naturally the information driven nature of ICA and can be used for routine and automatic ranking of independent components calculated from the functional neuroimaging data collected within event-related paradigms.},

abstract = {Objective: Electromyogram (EMG) contamination is often a problem in electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, particularly, for those applications such as EEG-based brain-computer interfaces that rely on automated measurements of EEG features. As an essential prelude to developing methods for recognizing and eliminating EMG contamination of EEG, this study defines the spectral and topographical characteristics of frontalis and temporalis muscle EMG over the entire scalp. It describes both average data and the range of individual differences. Methods: In 25 healthy adults, signals from 64 scalp and 4 facial locations were recorded during relaxation and during defined (15, 30, or 70{\%} of maximum) contractions of frontalis or temporalis muscles. Results: In the average data, EMG had a broad frequency distribution from 0 to {\textgreater}200 Hz. Amplitude was greatest at 20-30 Hz frontally and 40-80 Hz temporally. Temporalis spectra also showed a smaller peak around 20 Hz. These spectral components attenuated and broadened centrally. Even with weak (15{\%}) contraction, EMG was detectable (P{\textless}0.001) near the vertex at frequencies {\textgreater}12 Hz in the average data and {\textgreater}8 Hz in some individuals. Conclusions: Frontalis or temporalis muscle EMG recorded from the scalp has spectral and topographical features that vary substantially across individuals. EMG spectra often have peaks in the beta frequency range that resemble EEG beta peaks. Significance: While EMG contamination is greatest at the periphery of the scalp near the active muscles, even weak contractions can produce EMG that obscures or mimics EEG alpha, mu, or beta rhythms over the entire scalp. Recognition and elimination of this contamination is likely to require recording from an appropriate set of peripheral scalp locations. {\textcopyright} 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Subsequent studies showed that learning about the neural bases of human behavior, through either lab-based manipulations or attendance at an undergraduate neuroscience course, reduced people's support for retributive punishment (Studies 2-4). These results illustrate that exposure to debates about free will and to scientific research on the neural basis of behavior may have consequences for attributions of moral responsibility.},

abstract = {In NCX proteins CBD1 and CBD2 domains are connected through a short linker (3 or 4 amino acids) forming a regulatory tandem (CBD12). Only three of the six CBD12 Ca2+-binding sites contribute to NCX regulation. Two of them are located on CBD1 (Kd=∼0.2 $\mu$M), and one is on CBD2 (K d=∼5 $\mu$M). Here we analyze how the intrinsic properties of individual regulatory sites are affected by linker-dependent interactions in CBD12 (AD splice variant). The three sites of CBD12 and CBD1 + CBD2 have comparableKd values but differ dramatically in their Ca2+ dissociation kinetics. CBD12 exhibits multiphasic kinetics for the dissociation of three Ca2+ ions (kr + 280 s-1, kf + 7 s-1, and ks = 0.4 s-1), whereas the dissociation of two Ca2+ ions from CBD1 (kf=16 s -1) and one Ca2+ ion from CBD2 (kr = 125 s -1) is monophasic. Insertion of seven alanines into the linker (CBD12-7Ala) abolishes slow dissociation of Ca2+, whereas the kinetic and equilibrium properties of three Ca2+ sites of CBD12-7Ala and CBD1 + CBD2 are similar. Therefore, the linker-dependent interactions in CBD12 decelerate the Ca2+ on/off kinetics at a specific CBD1 site by 50-80-fold, thereby representing Ca2+ "occlusion" at CBD12. Notably, the kinetic and equilibrium properties of the remaining two sites of CBD12 are "linker-independent," so their intrinsic properties are preserved in CBD12. In conclusion, the dynamic properties of three sites are specifically modified, conserved, diversified, and integrated by the linker in CBD12, thereby generating a wide range dynamic sensor. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Our ability to recognize objects despite large changes in position, size, and context is achieved through computations that are thought to increase both the shape selectivity and the tolerance ("invariance") of the visual representation at successive stages of the ventral pathway [visual cortical areas V1, V2, and V4 and inferior temporal cortex (IT)]. However, these ideas have proven difficult to test. Here, we consider how well population activity patterns at two stages of the ventral stream (V4 and IT) discriminate between, and generalize across, different images. We found that both V4 and IT encode natural images with similar fidelity, whereas the IT population is much more sensitive to controlled, statistical scrambling of those images. Scrambling sensitivity was proportional to receptive field (RF) size in both V4 and IT, suggesting that, on average, the number of visual feature conjunctions implemented by a V4 or IT neuron is directly related to its RF size. We also found that the IT population could better discriminate between objects across changes in position, scale, and context, thus directly demonstrating a V4-to-IT gain in tolerance. This tolerance gain could be accounted for by both a decrease in single-unit sensitivity to identity-preserving transformations (e.g., an increase in RF size) and an increase in the maintenance of rank-order object selectivity within the RF. These results demonstrate that, as visual information travels from V4 to IT, the population representation is reformatted to become more selective for feature conjunctions and more tolerant to identity preserving transformations, and they reveal the single-unit response properties that underlie that reformatting.},

abstract = {In humans, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to induce, depending on polarity, increases or decreases of cortical excitability by polarization of the underlying brain tissue. Cognitive enhancement as a result of tDCS has been reported. The purpose of this study was to test whether weak tDCS (current density, 57 microA/cm(2)) can be used to modify language processing. Fifteen healthy subjects performed a visual picture naming task before, during and after tDCS applied over the posterior perisylvian region (PPR), i.e. an area which includes Wernicke's area [BA 22]. Four different sessions were carried out: (1) anodal and (2) cathodal stimulation of left PPR and, for control, (3) anodal stimulation of the homologous region of the right hemisphere and (4) sham stimulation. We found that subjects responded significantly faster following anodal tDCS to the left PPR (p{\textless}0.01). No decreases in performance were detected. Our finding of a transient improvement in a language task following the application of tDCS together with previous studies which investigated the modulation of picture naming latency by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) suggest that tDCS applied to the left PPR (including Wernicke's area [BA 22]) can be used to enhance language processing in healthy subjects. Whether this safe, low cost, and easy to use brain stimulation technique can be used to ameliorate deficits of picture naming in aphasic patients needs further investigations.},

abstract = {Reverse replay of hippocampal place cells occurs frequently at rewarded locations, suggesting its contribution to goal-directed path learning. Symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity STDP in CA3 likely potentiates recurrent synapses for both forward start to goal and reverse goal to start replays during sequential activation of place cells. However, how reverse replay selectively strengthens forward synaptic pathway is unclear. Here, we show computationally that firing sequences bias synaptic transmissions to the opposite direction of propagation under symmetric STDP in the co-presence of short-term synaptic depression or afterdepolarization. We demonstrate that significant biases are created in biologically realistic simulation settings, and this bias enables reverse replay to enhance goal-directed spatial memory on a W-maze. Further, we show that essentially the same mechanism works in a two-dimensional open field. Our model for the first time provides the mechanistic account for the way reverse replay contributes to hippocampal sequence learning for reward-seeking spatial navigation.},

While subjects maintained central eye fixation, ERPs were recorded to words presented to the left and right visual fields. In each of 6 runs, subjects focussed attention to alternate fields to perform a category-detection task. Pairs of semantically related and repeated words were embedded in the word lists presented to the attended and unattended visual fields. Consistent with prior studies, the P1-N1 visual ERP was larger when elicited by words in attended spatial locations. A large negative slow wave identified as N400 was elicited by attended, but not unattended, words. For attended words, N400 was smaller for semantically primed or repeated words. We concluded that spatial selective attention can modulate the degree to which words are processed, and that the cognitive processes associated with N400 are not automatic.},

@article{Escera2003,
abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from the scalp to investigate a long-standing controversy in auditory attention research, namely when the 'breakthrough of the unattended' takes place in the human brain. Nine subjects classified visual stimuli appearing 300 ms after task-irrelevant standard tones (80{\%}, i.e. P = 0.8) or novel sounds (20{\%}, i.e. P = 0.2) into odd/even categories. After the recording session, subjects scored the novel sounds as to whether they had any particular meaning (identifiable) or were perceived as a burst of noise (non-identifiable), and performance and ERPs were analysed according to this classification. A control condition, in which the visual stimuli were presented with no sounds, showed that subjects covertly monitored the task-irrelevant sounds during visual task-performance, and a further condition, in which the auditory and visual stimuli appeared regardless of each other, made it possible to trace the processing of the distracters during allocation of attention outside the auditory environment. Results yielded identical N1-enhancement for the two types of novel sounds, indicating similar attention switching triggered to these two types of unexpected sounds. However, there was a stronger orientating of attention towards identifiable novel sounds, as indicated both by behavioural distraction and by larger novelty-P3. Furthermore, this stronger orientating of attention was due to the sounds being contingent on the visual stimuli, as no increase in novelty-P3 to identifiable novel sounds was observed in the control condition, in which the sounds occurred outside the attentional set. Therefore, provided that the N1-enhancement reflects a call for focal attention, and novelty-P3 the effective orientating of attention towards the eliciting sounds, the present results suggest that semantic analysis of significant sounds occurs after a transitory switch of attention towards the eliciting stimuli. Moreover, as the novelty-P3 increase in amplitude was observed only when subjects covertly monitored the sounds, the present data suggest that semantic analysis of irrelevant sounds depends on the top-down cognitive influences of the attentional set.},

For this reason "embodiment" represents an innovative and very suitable experimental paradigm when studying the neural processes underlying learning new behaviors and adapting to unpredicted situations. To this purpose, we developed a novel bidirectional neural interface. We interconnected in vitro neurons, extracted from rat embryos and plated on a microelectrode array (MEA), to external devices, thus allowing real-time closed-loop interaction. The novelty of this experimental approach entails the necessity to explore different computational schemes and experimental hypotheses. In this paper, we present an open, scalable architecture, which allows fast prototyping of different modules and where coding and decoding schemes and different experimental configurations can be tested. This hybrid system can be used for studying the computational properties and information coding in biological neuronal networks with far-reaching implications for the future development of advanced neuroprostheses.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Many cellular processes involve a small number of molecules and undergo stochastic fluctuations in their levels of activity. Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a form of synaptic plasticity expressed as a reduction in the number of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in Purkinje cells. We developed a stochastic model of the LTD signaling network, including a PKC-ERK-cPLA 2 positive feedback loop and mechanisms of AMPAR trafficking, and tuned the model to replicate calcium uncaging experiments. The signaling network activity in single synapses switches between two discrete stable states (LTD and non-LTD) in a probabilistic manner. The stochasticity of the signaling network causes threshold dithering and allows at the macroscopic level for many different and stable mean magnitudes of depression. The probability of LTD occurrence in a single spine is only modulated by the concentration and duration of the signal used to trigger it, and inputs with the same magnitude can give rise to two different responses; there is no threshold for the input signal. The stochasticity is intrinsic to the signaling network and not mostly dependent on noise in the calcium input signal, as has been suggested previously. The activities of the ultrasensitive ERK and of cPLA 2 undergo strong stochastic fluctuations. Conversely, PKC, which acts as a noise filter, is more constantly activated. Systematic variation of the biochemical population size demonstrates that threshold dithering and the absence of spontaneous LTD depend critically on the number of molecules in a spine, indicating constraints on spine size in Purkinje cells. {\textcopyright} 2012 the authors.},

abstract = {This research investigated whether the physical act of enclosing an emotionally laden stimulus can help alleviate the associated negative emotions. Four experiments found support for this claim. In Experiments 1a and 1b, emotional negativity was reduced for participants who placed a written recollection of a regretted past decision or unsatisfied strong desire inside an envelope. However, enclosing a stimulus unrelated to the emotional experience did not have the same effect (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, we showed that the effect was not driven by participants simply doing something extra with the materials, and that the effect of physical enclosure was mediated by the psychological closure that participants felt toward the event.},

@article{Smallwood2011,
abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that the brain can efficiently process both external and internal information. The processing of internal information is a distinct "offline" cognitive mode that requires not only spontaneously generated mental activity; it has also been hypothesized to require a decoupling of attention from perception in order to separate competing streams of internal and external information. This process of decoupling is potentially adaptive because it could prevent unimportant external events from disrupting an internal train of thought. Here, we use measurements of pupil diameter (PD) to provide concrete evidence for the role of decoupling during spontaneous cognitive activity. First, during periods conducive to offline thought but not during periods of task focus, PD exhibited spontaneous activity decoupled from task events. Second, periods requiring external task focus were characterized by large task evoked changes in PD; in contrast, encoding failures were preceded by episodes of high spontaneous baseline PD activity. Finally, high spontaneous PD activity also occurred prior to only the slowest 20{\%} of correct responses, suggesting high baseline PD indexes a distinct mode of cognitive functioning. Together, these data are consistent with the decoupling hypothesis, which suggests that the capacity for spontaneous cognitive activity depends upon minimizing disruptions from the external world.},

@article{Sheliga1994,
abstract = {According to the premotor theory of attention, the mechanisms responsible for spatial attention and the mechanisms involved in programming ocular saccades are basically the same. The aim of the present experiments was to test this claim. In experiment 1 subjects were presented with a visual display consisting of a fixation point and four boxes arranged horizontally and located above the fixation cross. Two of the boxes were in the left visual hemifield, two in the right. A fifth box was located on the vertical meridian below the fixation cross. Digit cues indicated in which of the upper boxes the imperative stimulus was most likely to appear. Subjects were instructed to direct attention to the cued box and to perform a saccadic eye movement to the lower box on presentation of the imperative stimulus. The trajectory of the saccades deviated contralateral to the hemifield in which the imperative stimulus was presented. This deviation was larger when the hemifield where the imperative stimulus was presented was the cued one. In experiment 2, the visual display consisted of five boxes forming a cross. The central box served as a fixation point. The cue was a small line, linked to the central box, pointing to different directions and indicating where the visual imperative stimulus would appear. In 50{\%} of trials, the imperative stimulus was a visual stimulus presented either in one of the lateral boxes or in the central one. In the remaining 50{\%} of trials, the imperative stimulus was a non-lateralised sound. Half the subjects were instructed to make a saccade to the upper box at the presentation of the visual imperative stimulus and to the lower box at the presentation of the acoustic stimulus. Half the subjects received the opposite instructions. The results confirmed that the saccades deviate contralateral to the hemifield of stimulus presentation in the case of visual imperative stimuli. Most importantly, they showed that the saccades deviate contralateral to the cued hemifield, also in the case of acoustic imperative stimuli. Experiment 3 was similar to experiment 2. It confirmed the results of that experiment and showed that slow ocular drifts, which are observed in the time interval between cue and imperative stimulus presentation, cannot explain the ocular deviations. Taken together, the experiments demonstrate that spatial attention allocation leads to an activation of oculomotor circuits, in spite of eye immobility.},

abstract = {Numerous word recognition studies conducted over the past 2 decades are examined. These studies manipulated lexical familiarity by presenting words of high versus low printed frequency and most reported an interaction between printed frequency and one of several second variables, namely, orthographic regularity, semantic concreteness, or polysemy. However, the direction of these interactions was inconsistent from study to study. Six new experiments clarify these discordant results. The first two demonstrate that words of the same low printed frequency are not always equally familiar to subjects. Instead, subjects' ratings of “experiential familiarity” suggest that many of the low-printed-frequency words used in prior studies varied along this dimension. Four lexical decision experiments reexamine the prior findings by orthogonally manipulating lexical familiarity, as assessed by experiential familiarity ratings, with bigram frequency, semantic concreteness, and number of meanings. The results suggest that of these variables, only experiential familiarity reliably affects word recognition latencies. This in turn suggests that previous inconsistent findings are due to confounding experiential familiarity with a second variable. Tw},

Subjects with reading difficulty exhibited decreased diffusion anisotropy bilaterally in temporoparietal white matter. Axons in these regions were predominantly anterior-posterior in direction. No differences in T1-weighted MRI signal were found between poor readers and control subjects, demonstrating specificity of the group difference to the microstructural characteristics measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). White matter diffusion anisotropy in the temporo-parietal region of the left hemisphere was significantly correlated with reading scores within the reading-impaired adults and within the control group. The anisotropy reflects microstructure of white matter tracts, which may contribute to reading ability by determining the strength of communication between cortical areas involved in visual, auditory, and language processing.},

abstract = {In a dichotic listening paradigm, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to linguistic and nonlinguistic probe stimuli embedded in 2 different narrative contexts as they were either attended or unattended. In adults, the typical N1 attention effect was observed for both types of probes: Probes superimposed on the attended narrative elicited an enhanced negativity compared to the same probes when unattended. Overall, this sustained attention effect was greater over medial and left lateral sites, but was more posteriorly distributed and of longer duration for linguistic as compared to nonlinguistic probes. In contrast, in 6- to 8-year-old children the ERPs were morphologically dissimilar to those elicited in adults and children displayed a greater positivity to both types of probe stimuli when embedded in the attended as compared to the unattended narrative. Although both adults and children showed attention effects beginning at about 100 msec, only adults displayed left-lateralized attention effects and a distinct, posterior distribution for linguistic probes. These results suggest that the attentional networks indexed by this task continue to develop beyond the age of 8 years.},

Available functions include EEG data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu.

abstract = {Distinguishing between speakers and focusing attention on one speaker in multi-speaker environments is extremely important in everyday life. Exactly how the brain accomplishes this feat and, in particular, the precise temporal dynamics of this attentional deployment are as yet unknown. A long history of behavioral research using dichotic listening paradigms has debated whether selective attention to speech operates at an early stage of processing based on the physical characteristics of the stimulus or at a later stage during semantic processing. With its poor temporal resolution fMRI has contributed little to the debate, while EEG-ERP paradigms have been hampered by the need to average the EEG in response to discrete stimuli which are superimposed onto ongoing speech. This presents a number of problems, foremost among which is that early attention effects in the form of endogenously generated potentials can be so temporally broad as to mask later attention effects based on the higher level processing of the speech stream. Here we overcome this issue by utilizing the AESPA (auditory evoked spread spectrum analysis) method which allows us to extract temporally detailed responses to two concurrently presented speech streams in natural cocktail-party-like attentional conditions without the need for superimposed probes. We show attentional effects on exogenous stimulus processing in the 200-220 ms range in the left hemisphere. We discuss these effects within the context of research on auditory scene analysis and in terms of a flexible locus of attention that can be deployed at a particular processing stage depending on the task.},

The kinetic model for vesicle release has two calcium sensors, a sensor for fast synchronous release that lasts a few tens of milliseconds and a separate sensor for slow asynchronous release that lasts a few hundred milliseconds. A wide range of data can be accounted for consistently only when a refractory period lasting a few milliseconds between releases is included. The inclusion of a second sensor for asynchronous release with a slow unbinding site, and thereby a long memory, affects short-term plasticity by facilitating release. Our simulations also reveal a third time scale of vesicle release that is correlated with the stimulus and is distinct from the fast and the slow releases. In these detailed Monte Carlo simulations all three time scales of vesicle release are insensitive to the spatial details of the synaptic ultrastructure. Furthermore, our simulations allow us to identify features of synaptic transmission that are universal and those that are modulated by structure. {\textcopyright} 2010 Nadkarni et al.},

abstract = {Everyday life requires frequent shifts between cognitive tasks. Research reviewed in this article probes the control processes that reconfigure mental resources for a change of task by requiring subjects to switch frequently among a small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses are substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone immediately after a task switch. This 'switch cost' is reduced, but not eliminated, by an opportunity for preparation. It seems to result from both transient and long-term carry-over of 'task-set' activation and inhibition as well as time consumed by task-set reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging studies of task switching have revealed extra activation in numerous brain regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate 'controlling' from 'controlled' regions.},

abstract = {Speech recognition is an active process that involves some form of predictive coding. This statement is relatively uncontroversial. What is less clear is the source of the prediction. The dualstream model of speech processing suggests that there are two possible sources of predictive coding in speech perception: the motor speech system and the lexical-conceptual system. Here I provide an overview of the dual-stream model of speech processing and then discuss evidence concerning the source of predictive coding during speech recognition. I conclude that, in contrast to recent theoretical trends, the dorsal sensory-motor stream is not a source of forward prediction that can facilitate speech recognition. Rather, it is forward prediction coming out of the ventral stream that serves this function.},

@article{Escera1998,
abstract = {Behavioral and event-related brain potential (ERP) measures were used to elucidate the neural mechanisms of involuntary engagement of attention by novelty and change in the acoustic environment. The behavioral measures consisted of the reaction time (RT) and performance accuracy (hit rate) in a forcedchoice visual RT task where subjects were to discriminate between odd and even numbers. Each visual stimulus was preceded by an irrelevant auditory stimulus, which was randomly either a “standard” tone (80{\%}), a slightly, higher “deviant” tone (10{\%}), or a natural, “novel” sound (10{\%}). Novel sounds prolonged the RT to successive visual stimuli by 17 msec as compared with the RT to visual stimuli that followed standard tones. Deviant tones, in turn, decreased the hit rate but did not signicantly affect the RT. In the ERPs to deviant tones, the mismatch negativity (MMN), peaking at 150 msec, and a second negativity, peaking at 400 msec, could be observed. Novel sounds elicited an enhanced N1, with a probable overlap by the MMN, and a large positive P3a response with two different subcomponents: an early centrally dominant P3a, peaking at 230 msec, and a late P3a, peaking at 315 msec with a right-frontal scalp maximum. The present results suggest the involvement of two different neural mechanisms in triggering involuntary attention to acoustic novelty and change: a transient- detector mechanism activated by novel sounds and reected in the N1 and a stimulus-change detector mechanism activated by deviant tones and novel sounds and reected in the MMN. The observed differential distracting effects by slightly deviant tones and widely deviant novel sounds support the notion of two separate mechanisms of involuntary attention},

abstract = {Selective visual attention to objects and locations depends both on deliberate behavioral goals that regulate even early visual representations (goal-directed influences) and on autonomous neural responses to sensory input (stimulus-driven influences), In this chapter, I argue that deliberate goal-directed attentional strategies are always constrained by involuntary, "hard-wired" computations, and that an appropriate research strategy is to delineate the nature of the interactions imposed by these constraints. To illustrate the interaction between goal-directed and stimulus-driven attentional control, four domains of visual selection are reviewed. First, selection by location is both spatially and temporally limited, reflecting in part early visual representations of the scene. Second, selection by feature is an available attentional strategy, but it appears to be mediated by location, and feature salience alone does not govern the deployment of attention. Third, early visual segmentation processes that parse a scene into perceptual object representations enable object-based selection, but they also enforce selection of entire objects, and not just isolated features. And fourth, the appearance of a new perceptual object captures attention in a stimulus-driven fashion, but even this is subject to some top-down attentional control. Possible mechanisms for the interaction between bottom-up and top-down control are discussed.},

Sixty professional Wall Street traders were genotyped and compared to a control group who did not trade stocks. We found that distinct alleles of the dopamine receptor 4 promoter (DRD4P) and catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (COMT) that affect synaptic dopamine were predominant in traders. These alleles are associated with moderate, rather than very high or very low, levels of synaptic dopamine. The activity of these alleles correlated positively with years spent trading stocks on Wall Street. Differences in personality and trading behavior were also correlated with allelic variants. This evidence suggests there may be a genetic basis for the traits that make one a successful trader.},

Subjects searched multielement displays for a salient green circle that had a unique form when surrounded by green nontarget squares or had a unique color when surrounded by red nontarget circles. In the distractor conditions, a salient item in the other dimension was present as well. As an extension of earlier findings (Theeuwes, 1991), the results showed that complete top-down selectivity toward a particular feature was not possible, not even after extended and consistent practice. The results reveal that selectivity depends on the relative discriminability of the stimulus dimensions: the presence of an irrelevant item with a unique color interferes with parallel search for a unique form, and vice versa.},

The current article starts to address this question by introducing the idea of a set representation. This idea was tested using two new paradigms: mean discrimination and member identification. Three experiments using sets of different-sized spots showed that observers know a set's mean quite accurately but know little about the individual items, except their range. Taken together, these results suggest that the visual system represents the overall statistical, and not individual, properties of sets.},

abstract = {The immunointensities of calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin  D28K were quantified in different parts of Purkinje cells and interneurons (basket cells and stellate cells) of the rat cerebellum. An electron microscopic, postembedding immunogold procedure on Lowicryl K4M-embedded thin sections was applied. Neuronal profiles were identified by double-labeling immunocytochemistry using the combination of the two primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-rat calbindin D28K and rabbit polyclonal anti-rat PV. The secondary antibodies were conjugated with colloidal gold of different sizes (10 and 15 nm diameter). In the cerebellar cortex, double-labeled profiles were identified as Purkinje cells and profiles labeled only with anti-PV were identified as inteneurons. The densities of gold particles were used for statistical comparison of the relative levels of PV and calbindin D28K in somata, dendrites, dendritic spines, axons and axon terminals of Purkinje cells, and interneurons. The axons and axon terminals of Purkinje cells and basket cells had significantly higher levels of PV immunoreactivity than Purkinje cell somata, primary, secondary, and tertiary dendrites, and dendritic spines, as well as interneuron somata. On the other hand, the present study could not determine conclusively whether calbindin D28K was distributed homogeneously throughout soma, dendrites, and axons of Purkinje cells or was also concentrated in Purkinje cell axons. To estimate absolute PV concentrations, we made a series of artificial standard samples which were aldehyde-fixed 10{\%} bovine serum albumin containing given concentrations of PV (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 microM, 1 and 2 mM), and calibration curves were deduced from quantitative immunogold analyses of these standard samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

However, the type of high-threshold (HT) model used to derive this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that have been criticized in other experimental paradigms (e.g., visual search). Here we report findings from nine experiments in which VSTM for color, spatial frequency, and orientation was modeled using a signal detection theory (SDT) approach. In Experiments 1-6, two arrays composed of multiple stimulus elements were presented for 100 ms with a 1500 ms ISI. Observers were asked to report in a yes/no fashion whether there was any difference between the first and second arrays, and to rate their confidence in their response on a 1-4 scale. In Experiments 1-3, only one stimulus element difference could occur (T = 1) while set size was varied. In Experiments 4-6, set size was fixed while the number of stimuli that might change was varied (T = 1, 2, 3, and 4). Three general models were tested against the receiver operating characteristics generated by the six experiments. In addition to the HT model, two SDT models were tried: one assuming summation of signals prior to a decision, the other using a max rule. In Experiments 7-9, observers were asked to directly report the relevant feature attribute of a stimulus presented 1500 ms previously, from an array of varying set size. Overall, the results suggest that observers encode stimuli independently and in parallel, and that performance is limited by internal noise, which is a function of set size.},

abstract = {Language differences in verbal short-term memory were investigated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, bilinguals with high competence in English and French and monolingual English adults with extremely limited knowledge of French were assessed on their serial recall of words and nonwords in both languages. In all cases recall accuracy was superior in the language with which individuals were most familiar, a first-language advantage that remained when variation due to differential rates of articulation in the two languages was taken into account. In Experiment 2, bilinguals recalled lists of English and French words with and without concurrent articulatory suppression. First-language superiority persisted under suppression, suggesting that the language differences in recall accuracy were not attributable to slower rates of subvocal rehearsal in the less familiar language. The findings indicate that language-specific differences in verbal short-term memory do not exclusively originate in the subvocal rehearsal process. It is suggested that one source of language-specific variation might relate to the use of long-term knowledge to support short-term memory performance.},

abstract = {The brain has an extraordinary ability to functionally and physically change or reconfigure its structure in response to environmental stimulus, cognitive demand, or behavioral experience. This property, known as neuroplasticity, has been examined extensively in many domains. But how does neuroplasticity occur in the brain as a function of an individual's experience with a second language? It is not until recently that we have gained some understanding of this question by examining the anatomical changes as well as functional neural patterns that are induced by the learning and use of multiple languages. In this article we review emerging evidence regarding how structural neuroplasticity occurs in the brain as a result of one's bilingual experience. Our review aims at identifying the processes and mechanisms that drive experience-dependent anatomical changes, and integrating structural imaging evidence with current knowledge of functional neural plasticity of language and other cognitive skills. The evidence reviewed so far portrays a picture that is highly consistent with structural neuroplasticity observed for other domains: second language experience-induced brain changes, including increased gray matter (GM) density and white matter (WM) integrity, can be found in children, young adults, and the elderly; can occur rapidly with short-term language learning or training; and are sensitive to age, age of acquisition, proficiency or performance level, language-specific characteristics, and individual differences. We conclude with a theoretical perspective on neuroplasticity in language and bilingualism, and point to future directions for research.},

abstract = {The classic account of the Load Theory (LT) of attention suggests that increasing cognitive load leads to greater processing of task-irrelevant stimuli due to competition for limited executive resource that reduces the ability to actively maintain current processing priorities. Studies testing this hypothesis have yielded widely divergent outcomes. The inconsistent results may, in part, be related to variability in executive capacity (EC) and task difficulty across subjects in different studies. Here, we used a cross-modal paradigm to investigate whether augmented working memory (WM) load leads to increased early distracter processing, and controlled for the potential confounders of EC and task difficulty. Twenty-three young subjects were engaged in a primary visual WM task, under high and low load conditions, while instructed to ignore irrelevant auditory stimuli. Demands of the high load condition were individually titrated to make task difficulty comparable across subjects with differing EC. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to measure neural activity in response to stimuli presented in both the task relevant modality (visual) and task-irrelevant modality (auditory). Behavioral results indicate that the load manipulation and titration procedure of the primary visual task were successful. ERPs demonstrated that in response to visual target stimuli, there was a load-related increase in the posterior slow wave, an index of sustained attention and effort. Importantly, under high load, there was a decrease of the auditory N1 in response to distracters, a marker of early auditory processing. These results suggest that increased WM load is associated with enhanced attentional engagement and protection from distraction in a cross-modal setting, even after controlling for task difficulty and EC. Our findings challenge the classic LT and offer support for alternative models.},

abstract = {Several behavioral and brain imaging studies have demonstrated a significant interaction between speech perception and speech production. In this study, auditory cortical responses to speech were examined during self-production and feedback alteration. Magnetic field recordings were obtained from both hemispheres in subjects who spoke while hearing controlled acoustic versions of their speech feedback via earphones. These responses were compared to recordings made while subjects listened to a tape playback of their production. The amplitude of tape playback was adjusted to match the amplitude of self-produced speech. Recordings of evoked responses to both self-produced and tape-recorded speech were obtained free of movement-related artifacts. Responses to self-produced speech were weaker than were responses to tape-recorded speech. Responses to tones were also weaker during speech production, when compared with responses to tones recorded in the presence of speech from tape playback. However, responses evoked by gated noise stimuli did not differ for recordings made during self-produced speech versus recordings made during tape-recorded speech playback. These data suggest that during speech production, the auditory cortex (1) attenuates its sensitivity and (2) modulates its activity as a function of the expected acoustic feedback.},

abstract = {Prenatal androgens have important organizing effects on brain development and future behavior. The second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D) has been proposed as a marker of these prenatal androgen effects, a relatively longer fourth finger indicating higher prenatal androgen exposure. 2D:4D has been shown to predict success in highly competitive sports. Yet, little is known about the effects of prenatal androgens on an economically influential class of competitive risk taking-trading in the financial world. Here, we report the findings of a study conducted in the City of London in which we sampled 2D:4D from a group of male traders engaged in what is variously called "noise" or "high-frequency" trading. We found that 2D:4D predicted the traders' long-term profitability as well as the number of years they remained in the business. 2D:4D also predicted the sensitivity of their profitability to increases both in circulating testosterone and in market volatility. Our results suggest that prenatal androgens increase risk preferences and promote more rapid visuomotor scanning and physical reflexes. The success and longevity of traders exposed to high levels of prenatal androgens further suggests that financial markets may select for biological traits rather than rational expectations.},

abstract = {A number of electroencephalography (EEG) studies have investigated the time course of brain activation during overt word production. The interpretation of their results is complicated by the fact that articulatory movements may mask the cognitive components of interest. The first aim of the present study was to investigate when speech artifacts occur during word production planning and what effects they have on the spatio-temporal neural activation pattern. The second aim was to propose a new method that strongly attenuates speech artifacts during overt picture naming and to compare it with existing methods. EEG and surface electromyograms (EMGs) of the lips were recorded while participants overtly named pictures in a picture-word interference paradigm. The comparison of the raw data with lip EMG and the comparison of source localizations of raw and corrected EEG data showed that speech artifacts occurred mainly from {\~{}}. 400. ms post-stimulus onset, but some earlier artifacts mean that they occur much earlier than hitherto assumed. We compared previously used methods of speech artifacts removal (SAR) with a new method, which is based on Independent Component Analysis (SAR-ICA). Our new method clearly outperformed other methods. In contrast to other methods, there was only a weak correlation between the lip EMG and the corrected data by SAR-ICA. Also, only the data corrected with our method showed activation of cerebral sources consistent with meta-analyses of word production.},

@article{Bartol2015,
abstract = {We have built a stochastic model in the program MCell that simulates Ca(2+) transients in spines from the principal molecular components believed to control Ca(2+) entry and exit. Proteins, with their kinetic models, are located within two segments of dendrites containing 88 intact spines, centered in a fully reconstructed 6 × 6 × 5 $\mu$m(3) cube of hippocampal neuropil. Protein components include AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, L- and R-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers, plasma membrane Ca(2+) ATPases, smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPases, immobile Ca(2+) buffers, and calbindin. Kinetic models for each protein were taken from published studies of the isolated proteins in vitro. For simulation of electrical stimuli, the time course of voltage changes in the dendritic spine was generated with the desired stimulus in the program NEURON. Voltage-dependent parameters were then continuously re-adjusted during simulations in MCell to reproduce the effects of the stimulus. Nine parameters of the model were optimized within realistic experimental limits by a process that compared results of simulations to published data. We find that simulations in the optimized model reproduce the timing and amplitude of Ca(2+) transients measured experimentally in intact neurons. Thus, we demonstrate that the characteristics of individual isolated proteins determined in vitro can accurately reproduce the dynamics of experimentally measured Ca(2+) transients in spines. The model will provide a test bed for exploring the roles of additional proteins that regulate Ca(2+) influx into spines and for studying the behavior of protein targets in the spine that are regulated by Ca(2+) influx.},

abstract = {The brain is a large-scale complex network often referred to as the "connectome". Exploring the dynamic behavior of the connectome is a challenging issue as both excellent time and space resolution is required. In this context Magneto/Electroencephalography (M/EEG) are effective neuroimaging techniques allowing for analysis of the dynamics of functional brain networks at scalp level and/or at reconstructed sources. However, a tool that can cover all the processing steps of identifying brain networks from M/EEG data is still missing. In this paper, we report a novel software package, called EEGNET, running under MATLAB (Math works, inc), and allowing for analysis and visualization of functional brain networks from M/EEG recordings. EEGNET is developed to analyze networks either at the level of scalp electrodes or at the level of reconstructed cortical sources. It includes i) Basic steps in preprocessing M/EEG signals, ii) the solution of the inverse problem to localize / reconstruct the cortical sources, iii) the computation of functional connectivity among signals collected at surface electrodes or/and time courses of reconstructed sources and iv) the computation of the network measures based on graph theory analysis. EEGNET is the unique tool that combines the M/EEG functional connectivity analysis and the computation of network measures derived from the graph theory. The first version of EEGNET is easy to use, flexible and user friendly. EEGNET is an open source tool and can be freely downloaded from this webpage: https://sites.google.com/site/eegnetworks/.},

abstract = {Do humans search in memory using dynamic local-to-global search strategies similar to those that animals use to forage between patches in space? If so, do their dynamic memory search policies correspond to optimal foraging strategies seen for spatial foraging? Results from a number of fields suggest these possibilities, including the shared structure of the search problems-searching in patchy environments-and recent evidence supporting a domain-general cognitive search process. To investigate these questions directly, we asked participants to recover from memory as many animal names as they could in 3 min. Memory search was modeled over a representation of the semantic search space generated from the BEAGLE memory model of Jones and Mewhort (2007), via a search process similar to models of associative memory search (e.g., Raaijmakers {\&} Shiffrin, 1981). We found evidence for local structure (i.e., patches) in memory search and patch depletion preceding dynamic local-to-global transitions between patches. Dynamic models also significantly outperformed nondynamic models. The timing of dynamic local-to-global transitions was consistent with optimal search policies in space, specifically the marginal value theorem (Charnov, 1976), and participants who were more consistent with this policy recalled more items.},

abstract = {Humans are severely limited in their ability to memorize visual information over short periods of time. Selective attention has been implicated as a limiting factor. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis that this limitation is due to common neural resources shared by visual working memory (WM) and selective attention. We combined visual search and delayed discrimination of complex objects and independently modulated the demands on selective attention and WM encoding. Participants were presented with a search array and performed easy or difficult visual search in order to encode one or three complex objects into visual WM. Overlapping activation for attention-demanding visual search and WM encoding was observed in distributed posterior and frontal regions. In the right prefrontal cortex and bilateral insula blood oxygen-level-dependent activation additively increased with increased WM load and attentional demand. Conversely, several visual, parietal and premotor areas showed overlapping activation for the two task components and were severely reduced in their WM load response under the condition with high attentional demand. Regions in the left prefrontal cortex were selectively responsive to WM load. Areas selectively responsive to high attentional demand were found within the right prefrontal and bilateral occipital cortex. These results indicate that encoding into visual WM and visual selective attention require to a high degree access to common neural resources. We propose that competition for resources shared by visual attention and WM encoding can limit processing capabilities in distributed posterior brain regions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

We argue that, like for many other aspects of vision, several different circuits related to salience, object recognition, actions, and value ultimately interact to determine gaze behavior. Second, how are pursuit eye movements and perceptual experience of visual motion related? We show that motion perception and pursuit have a lot in common, but they also have separate noise sources that can lead to dissociations between them.

abstract = {Permutation test is a popular technique for testing a hypothesis of no effect, when the distribution of the test statistic is unknown. To test the equality of two means, a permutation test might use a test statistic which is the difference of the two sample means in the univariate case. In the multivariate case, it might use a test statistic which is the maximum of the univariate test statistics. A permutation test then estimates the null distribution of the test statistic by permuting the observations between the two samples. We will show that, for such tests, if the two distributions are not identical (as for example when they have unequal variances, correlations or skewness), then a permutation test for equality of means based on difference of sample means can have an inflated Type I error rate even when the means are equal. Our results illustrate permutation testing should be confined to testing for non-identical distributions. CONTACT: calian@raunvis.hi.is.},

@article{Poldrack2006,
abstract = {There is much interest currently in using functional neuroimaging techniques to understand better the nature of cognition. One particular practice that has become common is 'reverse inference', by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region. Such inferences are not deductively valid, but can still provide some information. Using a Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database, I characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference. Its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest. I argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference, particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Barsalou1999,
abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

@article{Scarborough1977,
abstract = {Five reaction time experiments explored word-frequency effects in word- nonword decision tasks and in pronunciation and memory tasks. High- frequency words were recognized substantially faster than low-frequency words in the word-nonword decision tasks. However, there was little effect of word frequency in the pronunciation and old-weiv memory tasks. Further, in the word-nonword lexical decision task, prior presentations of words produced substantial and apparently long-lasting reductions in the basic frequency effect. The occurrence of natural language frequency effects only in the word-nonword decision task supports the use of this task to study the organization of, and retrieval from, the subjective lexicon. The modification of frequency effects by repetition suggests that natural language frequency effects may be attributed partly to the recency with which words have occurred. Analysis of the response latencies using Sternberg's additive- factors approach indicates that frequency effects consist of both effects in encoding and in retrieval from memory.},

abstract = {Global context plays an important, but poorly understood, role in visual tasks. This study demonstrates that a robust memory for visual context exists to guide spatial attention. Global context was operationalized as the spatial layout of objects in visual search displays. Half of the configurations were repeated across blocks throughout the entire session, and targets appeared within consistent locations in these arrays. Targets appearing in learned configurations were detected more quickly. This newly discovered form of search facilitation is termed contextual cueing. Contextual cueing is driven by incidentally learned associations between spatial configurations (context) and target locations. This benefit was obtained despite chance performance for recognizing the configurations, suggesting that the memory for context was implicit. The results show how implicit learning and memory of visual context can guide spatial attention towards task-relevant aspects of a scene.},

At an apperceptive level, finer grain distinctions may be made; the authors distinguished here between disorders of shape recognition and perceptual integration. It is not the case, however, that all patients with visual recognition deficits have impaired perception: poor recognition and naming may also result from damage to stored perceptual knowledge (eg, structural descriptions), from problems in accessing semantic knowledge, from perceptual knowledge, or from impairments to semantic knowledge itself. These represent different types of associative deficit. In some cases, mild damage to stored perceptual knowledge also generates problems that are more severe on naming than on recognition and more severe for some categories of objects than others.},

abstract = {The human linguistic capacity is subject to multiple influences both within and outside the language system. Among the fac- tors that have been found to have a particularly robust influ- ence on efficiency of language processing is how similar or differ- ent a word is relative to other words. Similarities and differences among words can be examined at the phonological, orthographic, lexical, and semantic levels. For example, the size of a word's semantic network influences how fast the word can be accessed, with words that have larger semantic neighborhoods processed faster than words with sparse semantic neighborhoods (e.g., Bertram, Schreuder, {\&} Baayen, 2000; Locker, Simpson, {\&} Yates, 2003, Nelson, Schreiber, {\&} McEvoy, 1992). Similarly, the size of a word's phonological or orthographic neighborhood influences word access. A phonological neighbor is a word that differs from the tar- get word by a single phoneme (Grainger, Muneaux, Farioli, {\&} Ziegler, 2005; Yates, Locker, {\&} Simpson, 2004). A word's neighbor- hood size, also referred to as its neighborhood density, has been defined as the number of items that are highly similar to it. While phonology, orthography, and semantics are all subject to neighbor- hood density effects, with implications for lexical activation, the objectives of the present study were to examine the role of phono- logical density in lexical access during language production and to explore similarities and differences in phonological neighborhood density effects on native and non-native language processing.},

abstract = {Whether and how working memory disrupts or alters auditory selective attention is unclear. We compared simultaneous event-related potentials (ERP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses associated with task-irrelevant sounds across high and low working memory load in a dichotic-listening paradigm. Participants performed n-back tasks (1-back, 2-back) in one ear (Attend ear) while ignoring task-irrelevant speech sounds in the other ear (Ignore ear). The effects of working memory load on selective attention were observed at 130-210. ms, with higher load resulting in greater irrelevant syllable-related activation in localizer-defined regions in auditory cortex. The interaction between memory load and presence of irrelevant information revealed stronger activations primarily in frontal and parietal areas due to presence of irrelevant information in the higher memory load. Joint independent component analysis of ERP and fMRI data revealed that the ERP component in the N1 time-range is associated with activity in superior temporal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrate a dynamic relationship between working memory load and auditory selective attention, in agreement with the load model of attention and the idea of common neural resources for memory and attention. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Measurements of this kind have important commercial and clinical applications for optimizing the performance of users working under high mental load conditions, or as cognitive tests. Based on EEG recordings for a reading task in which three different levels of cognitive load were induced, it is shown that a set of spectral features--the spectral entropy, weighted mean frequency and its bandwidth, and spectral edge frequency--are all able to discriminate the three load levels effectively. An interesting result is that spectral entropy, which reflects the distribution of spectral energy rather than its magnitude, provides very good discrimination between cognitive load levels. We also report those EEG channels for which statistical significance between load levels was achieved. The effect of frequency bands on the spectral features is also investigated here. The results indicate that the choice of optimal frequency band can be dependent on the spectral feature extracted.},

Results showed: (1) Memory span is inversely related to word length across a wide range of materials; (2) When number of syllables and number of phonemes are held constant, words of short temporal duration are better recalled than words of long duration; (3) Span could be predicted on the basis of the number of words which the subject can read in approximately 2 sec; (4) When articulation is suppressed by requiring the subject to articulate an irrelevant sound, the word length effect disappears with visual presentation, but remains when presentation is auditory.

abstract = {Previous electrophysiological studies of automatic language processing revealed early (100-200 ms) reflections of access to lexical characteristics of speech signal using the so-called mismatch negativity (MMN), a negative ERP deflection elicited by infrequent irregularities in unattended repetitive auditory stimulation. In those studies, lexical processing of spoken stimuli became manifest as an enhanced ERP in response to unattended real words, as opposed to phonologically matched but meaningless pseudoword stimuli. This lexical ERP enhancement was explained by automatic activation of word memory traces realized as distributed strongly intra-connected neuronal circuits, whose robustness guarantees memory trace activation even in the absence of attention on spoken input. Such an account would predict the automatic activation of these memory traces upon any presentation of linguistic information, irrespective of the presentation modality. As previous lexical MMN studies exclusively used auditory stimulation, we here adapted the lexical MMN paradigm to investigate early automatic lexical effects in the visual modality. In a visual oddball sequence, matched short word and pseudoword stimuli were presented tachistoscopically in perifoveal area outside the visual focus of attention, as the subjects' attention was concentrated on a concurrent non-linguistic visual dual task in the center of the screen. Using EEG, we found a visual analogue of the lexical ERP enhancement effect, with unattended written words producing larger brain response amplitudes than matched pseudowords, starting at {\~{}}100 ms. Furthermore, we also found significant visual MMN, reported here for the first time for unattended perifoveal lexical stimuli. The data suggest early automatic lexical processing of visually presented language which commences rapidly and can take place outside the focus of attention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A paradoxical enhancement of the magnitude of the N1 wave of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) has been described when auditory stimuli are presented at very short ({\textless} 400 ms) inter-stimulus intervals (ISI). Here, we examined whether this enhancement is specific for the auditory system, or whether it also affects ERPs elicited by stimuli belonging to other sensory modalities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recorded ERPs elicited by auditory and somatosensory stimuli in 13 healthy subjects. For each sensory modality, 4800 stimuli were presented. Auditory stimuli consisted in brief tones presented binaurally, and somatosensory stimuli consisted in constant-current electrical pulses applied to the right median nerve. Stimuli were delivered continuously, and the ISI was varied randomly between 100 and 1000 ms. We found that the ISI had a similar effect on both auditory and somatosensory ERPs. In both sensory modalities, ISI had an opposite effect on the magnitude of the N1 and P2 waves: the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory N1 was significantly increased at ISI {\textless} or = 200 ms, while the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory P2 was significantly decreased at ISI {\textless} or = 200 ms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: The observation that both the auditory and the somatosensory N1 are enhanced at short ISIs indicates that this phenomenon reflects a physiological property that is common across sensory systems, rather than, as previously suggested, unique for the auditory system. Two of the hypotheses most frequently put forward to explain this observation, namely (i) the decreased contribution of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials to the recorded scalp ERPs and (ii) the decreased contribution of 'latent inhibition', are discussed. Because neither of these two hypotheses can satisfactorily account for the concomitant reduction of the auditory and the somatosensory P2, we propose a third, novel hypothesis, consisting in the modulation of a single neural component contributing to both the N1 and the P2 waves.},

@article{Dacey1996,
abstract = {Human color vision starts with the signals from three cone photoreceptor types, maximally sensitive to long (L-cone), middle (M-cone), and short (S-cone) wavelengths. Within the retina these signals combine in an antagonistic way to form red-green and blue-yellow spectral opponent pathways. In the classical model this antagonism is thought to arise from the convergence of cone type-specific excitatory and inhibitory inputs to retinal ganglion cells. The circuitry for spectral opponency is now being investigated using an in vitro preparation of the macaque monkey retina. Intracellular recording and staining has shown that blue-ON/yellow-OFF opponent responses arise from a distinctive bistratified ganglion cell type. Surprisingly, this cone opponency appears to arise by dual excitatory cone bipolar cell inputs: an ON bipolar cell that contacts only S-cones and an OFF bipolar cell that contacts L- and M-cones. Red-green spectral opponency has long been linked to the midget ganglion cells, but an underlying mechanism remains unclear. For example, receptive field mapping argues for segregation of L-and M-cone signals to the midget cell center and surround, but horizontal cell interneurons, believed to generate the inhibitory surround, lack opponency and cannot contribute selective L- or M-cone input to the midget cell surround. The solution to this color puzzle no doubt lies in the great diversity of cell types in the primate retina that still await discovery and analysis.},

abstract = {We compared individual-participant and jackknife-based methods for scoring the onset latencies of event-related potential (ERP) components using a diffusion process as a model for an ERP. We studied "ramp-like" components in which the true ERP increases or decreases monotonically, except for noise. If the growth rates of such components vary across participants, the jackknife-based measure can easily have only 10{\%}-20{\%} as much error variance as the traditional method, and this advantage is magnified with more participants. We also studied intersection-shaped or "bump-like" components. Jackknifing generally yielded smaller error variances with these components too, especially when the component's peak amplitude varied across participants, but less so if the component's peak latency varied. These results help illuminate the reasons for the superiority of jackknife-based onset latency measures over traditional measures in recent simulations.},

abstract = {The nature of information stemming from a single neuron and conveyed simultaneously to several hundred target neurons is not known. Triple and quadruple neuron recordings revealed that each synaptic connection established by neocortical pyramidal neurons is potentially unique. Specifically, synaptic connections onto the same morphological class differed in the numbers and dendritic locations of synaptic contacts, their absolute synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic depression and recovery from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated frequency-dependent depression and facilitation, respectively, during high frequency discharges of presynaptic action potentials, suggesting that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative differences in synaptic properties. Facilitating-type synaptic connections established by three pyramidal neurons of the same class onto a single interneuron, were all qualitatively similar with a combination of facilitation and depression mechanisms. The time courses of facilitation and depression, however, differed for these convergent connections, suggesting that different prepostsynaptic interactions underlie quantitative differences in synaptic properties. Mathematical analysis of the transfer functions of frequency-dependent synapses revealed supralinear, linear, and sub-linear signaling regimes in which mixtures of presynaptic rates, integrals of rates, and derivatives of rates are transferred to targets depending on the precise values of the synaptic parameters and the history of presynaptic action potential activity. Heterogeneity of synaptic transfer functions therefore allows multiple synaptic representations of the same presynaptic action potential train and suggests that these synaptic representations are regulated in a complex manner. It is therefore proposed that differential signaling is a key mechanism in neocortical information processing, which can be regulated by selective synaptic modifications.},

abstract = {Lexical decisions about high-frequency words are faster than about low-frequency words. It has been suggested that the locus of this effect is in a verification stage in which a frequency-ordered comparison takes place that requires the continuous availability of a sensory representation of the stimulus. This proposal was tested in 4 lexical-decision experiments, using 64 undergraduates. In Exp I, high- and low-frequency words and nonword stimuli remained visible until Ss responded. The stimuli in Exp II were illuminated for only 1 retrace on a video monitor (16.7 msec), and in Exp III, the single retrace was followed by a pattern mask 50 msec later. The latter 2 conditions have been suggested as manipulations that would eliminate the verification stage of recognition. Nevertheless, the effect of word frequency on decision latencies was comparable in all 3 experiments. Data from Exp IV eliminated orthographic regularity as a factor contributing to the obtained frequency effect. It is suggested that frequency has its effects prior to verification and that the notion of verification as the sole basis for frequency effects needs to be revised. (18 ref) },

Such signs include self-oriented behaviors while looking at the mirror to touch or remove a mark surreptitiously placed on the childs face. The authors attempted to replicate this finding across cultures using a simplified version of the classic mark test. In Experiment 1, Kenyan children (N = 82, 18 to 72 months old) display a pronounced absence of spontaneous self-oriented behaviors toward the mark. In Experiment 2, the authors tested children in Fiji, Saint Lucia, Grenada, and Peru (N = 133, 36 to 55 months old), as well as children from urban United States and rural Canada. As expected from existing reports, a majority of the Canadian and American children demonstrate spontaneous self-oriented behaviors toward the mark. However, markedly fewer children from the non-Western rural sites demonstrate such behaviors. These results suggest that there are profound cross-cultural differences in the meaning of the MSR test, questioning the validity of the mark test as a universal index of self-concept in childrens development.},

Such curves predict a reliable change of choice between some alternative rewards as a function of time.

For a single dimension the target 'pops out' and the search time is independent of the number of irrelevant items in the set. For conjunctions, the search time increases as the set becomes larger. Thus, it seems that the visual system is incapable of conducting a parallel search over two stimulus dimensions simultaneously. Here we extend this conclusion for the conjunction of motion and colour, showing that it requires a serial search. We also report two exceptions: if one of the dimensions in a conjunctive search is stereoscopic disparity, a second dimension of either colour or motion can be searched in parallel.},

Specifically, the local calcium influx responsible for vesicular release and short-term synaptic facilitation strongly depends on the distance between the voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) and the presynaptic active zone. Estimates for this distance range over two orders of magnitude. Here, we use a biophysically detailed computational model of the presynaptic bouton and demonstrate that available experimental data provide sufficient constraints to uniquely reconstruct the presynaptic architecture. We predict that for a typical CA3–CA1 synapse, there are {\~{}}70 VDCCs located 300 nm from the active zone. This result is surprising, because structural studies on other synapses in the hippocampus report much tighter spatial coupling.

The largest and earliest flanker effects were observed for congruent endings at the smallest visual angle (0.57 degrees); congruent endings and flankers in intermediate visual angle (0.97 degrees) conditions displayed a similar flanker-related negativity but with a longer onset latency (490 vs. 280 ms).

The findings replicate outcomes of prior repeated measures analysis of variance procedures on percentage of change scores. However, new information is added by the more refined analysis. The findings are also discussed in terms of previous laterality studies using similar tasks and subject samples.},

abstract = {A brain-computer interface(BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) translates the subject's motor intention into a control signal through classifying the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of different imagination tasks, e.g. hand and foot movements. Characteristic EEG spatial patterns make MI tasks substantially discriminable. Multi-channel EEGs are usually necessary for spatial pattern identification and therefore MI-based BCI is still in the stage of laboratory demonstration, to some extent, due to the need for constanly troublesome recording preparation. This paper presents a method for channel reduction in MI-based BCI. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method was employed to analyze spatial patterns of imagined hand and foot movements. Significant channels were selelcted by searching the maximunms of spatial pattern vectors in scalp mappings. A classification algorithm was developed by means of combining linear discriminat analysis towards even-related desynchronization (ERD) and readiness potential (RP). The classification accuracies with four optimal channels were 93.45{\%} and 91.88{\%} for two subjects.},

Similarly attention can be oriented to a semantic category such as " animals" or " tools" Words from the attended category will also be recognized faster than words from an unattended category. Here, we asked whether it is possible to orient attention to an emotional category, for example, " negative emotional stimuli" Furthermore, we investigated which mechanisms facilitate processing of attended stimuli. In an attentional orienting paradigm in which cues are informative with regard to the spatial location, semantic category, or emotional category of subsequent target words, we found attention effects in all three cue conditions. Words at attended locations or of the attended semantic or emotional category were responded to faster than unattended categories. While spatial attention acted upon early visual processing and amplified occipital N1-P2 potentials, semantic cues modulated the N400 amplitude indexing semantic processing. Emotional cues also yielded an N400 modulation; however, in addition, a left anterior P2 effect was observed. The data clearly show that attention can be oriented to emotional categories. Emotional orienting yields facilitated processing of an attended emotional category through the modulation of early and late word processing stages. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The N1 and P2 components of the event-related potential are relevant markers in the processing of auditory information, indicating the presence of several acoustic phenomena, such as pure tones or speech sounds. In addition, the expression of these components seems to be sensitive to diverse experimental variations. The main purpose of the present investigation was to explore the role of inter-stimulus interval (ISI) on the N1 and P2 responses, considering two widely used experimental paradigms: a single tone task (1000. Hz sound repeated in a fixed rhythm) and an auditory oddball (80{\%} of the stimuli were equal to the sound used in the single tone and the remaining were a 1500. Hz tone). Both tasks had four different conditions, and each one tested a fixed value of ISI (600, 1000, 3000, or 6000. ms). A sample of 22 participants performed these tasks, while an EEG was recorded, in order to examine the maximum amplitude of the N1 and P2 components. Analysis of the stimuli in the single tone task and the frequent tones in the oddball task revealed a similar outcome for both tasks and for both components: N1 and P2 amplitudes were enhanced in conditions with longer ISIs regardless of task. This response pattern emphasizes the dependence of both the N1 and P2 components on the ISI, especially in a scenario of repetitive and regular stimulation. The absence of task effects suggests that the ISI effect reported may depend on refractory mechanisms rather than being due to habituation effects.},

abstract = {The neural basis of decision making has been an elusive concept largely due to the many subprocesses associated with it. Recent efforts involving neuroimaging, neuropsychological studies, and animal work indicate that the prefrontal cortex plays a central role in several of these subprocesses. The frontal lobes are involved in tasks ranging from making binary choices to making multi-attribute decisions that require explicit deliberation and integration of diverse sources of information. In categorizing different aspects of decision making, a division of the prefrontal cortex into three primary regions is proposed. (1) The orbitofrontal and ventromedial areas are most relevant to deciding based on reward values and contribute affective information regarding decision attributes and options. (2) Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is critical in making decisions that call for the consideration of multiple sources of information, and may recruit separable areas when making well defined versus poorly defined decisions. (3) The anterior and ventral cingulate cortex appear especially relevant in sorting among conflicting options, as well as signaling outcome-relevant information. This topic is broadly relevant to cognitive neuroscience as a discipline, as it generally comprises several aspects of cognition and may involve numerous brain regions depending on the situation. The review concludes with a summary of how these regions may interact in deciding and possible future research directions for the field.},

abstract = {When web survey respondents self-administer a questionnaire, what they are doing is in many ways similar to what goes on in human–human interviews. The studies presented here demonstrate that enabling web survey respondents to engage in the equivalent of clarification dialogue can improve respondents' comprehension of questions and thus the accuracy of their answers, much as it can in human–human interviews. In two laboratory experiments, web survey respondents (1) answered more accurately when they could obtain clarification, that is, ground their understanding of survey questions, than when no clarification was available, and (2) answered particularly accurately with mixed-initiative clarification, where respondents could initiate clarification or the system could provide unsolicited clarification when respondents took too long to answer. Diagnosing the need for clarification based on respondent characteristics—in particular, age—proved more effective than relying on a generic model of all respondents' need for clarification. Although clarification dialogue increased response times, respondents preferred being able to request clarification than not. The current results suggest that bringing features of human dialogue to web surveys can exploit the advantages of both interviewer- and self-administration of questionnaires.

abstract = {Cooperativity is one of the most important properties of molecular interactions in biological systems. It is the ability to influence ligand binding at one site of a macromolecule by previous ligand binding at another site of the same molecule. As a consequence, the affinity of the macromolecule for the ligand is either decreased (negative cooperativity) or increased (positive cooperativity). Over the last 100 years, O2 binding to hemoglobin has served as the paradigm for cooperative ligand binding and allosteric modulation, and four practical models were developed to quantitatively describe the mechanism: the Hill, the Adair-Klotz, the Monod-Wyman-Changeux, and the Koshland-N{\'{e}}methy-Filmer models. The predictions of these models apply under static conditions when the binding reactions are at equilibrium. However, in a physiological setting, e.g., inside a cell, the timing and dynamics of the binding events are essential. Hence, it is necessary to determine the dynamic properties of cooperative binding to fully understand the physiological implications of cooperativity. To date, the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model was applied to determine the kinetics of cooperative binding to biologically active molecules. In this model, cooperativity is established by postulating two allosteric isoforms with different binding properties. However, these studies were limited to special cases, where transition rates between allosteric isoforms are much slower than the binding rates or where binding and unbinding rates could be measured independently. For all other cases, the complex mathematical description precludes straightforward interpretations. Here, we report on calculating for the first time the fast dynamics of a cooperative binding process, the binding of Ca2+ to calretinin. Calretinin is a Ca2+-binding protein with four cooperative binding sites and one independent binding site. The Ca2+ binding to calretinin was assessed by measuring the decay of free Ca 2+ using a fast fluorescent Ca2+ indicator following rapid ({\textless}50-$\mu$s rise time) Ca2+ concentration jumps induced by uncaging Ca2+ from DM-nitrophen. To unravel the kinetics of cooperative binding, we devised several approaches based on known cooperative binding models, resulting in a novel and relatively simple model. This model revealed unexpected and highly specific nonlinear properties of cellular Ca 2+ regulation by calretinin. The association rate of Ca2+ with calretinin speeds up as the free Ca2+ concentration increases from cytoplasmic resting conditions (∼100 nM) to approximately 1 $\mu$M. As a consequence, the Ca2+ buffering speed of calretinin highly depends on the prevailing Ca2+ concentration prior to a perturbation. In addition to providing a novel mode of action of cellular Ca2+ buffering, our model extends the analysis of cooperativity beyond the static steady-state condition, providing a powerful tool for the investigation of the dynamics and functional significance of cooperative binding in general. {\textcopyright} 2007 Faas et al.},

abstract = {In a selective attention experiment, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 12 subjects who listened to sequences of high and low frequency tone pips, presented binaurally in random order at a rapid rate. Their task was to attend selectively to either the high or low frequency tones and to press a button upon detection of occasional longer-duration tones at the appropriate frequency. The effect of attention was manifest in difference wave forms obtained by subtracting ERPs to the shorter tones when they were unattended from their ERPs to the same stimuli when they were attended. The difference waves consisted of a broad, multiphasic negative component (Nd) with its later phase (300-400 msec) being more frontally distributed on the scalp than either its early phase (100-300 msec) or the N1 component that was evoked in a reading condition. The amplitude and latency of onset of Nd varied systematically as a function of the frequency separation between the tones. It was concluded that the effect of selective auditory attention on the N1 component (ca. 100 msec latency) is not due solely to an enlargement of the exogenous N1 component of the vertex potential, but rather includes the addition of a prolonged endogenous component. A simple gating mechanism for human selective attention was thus rejected.},

abstract = {In vivo availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) protein has been reported to be reduced among alcoholics, and allelic variation of the DAT gene (SLC6A3) has been associated with severity of alcohol withdrawal. We examined the VNTR polymorphism of the 3' untranslated region of SLC6A3 and DAT protein availability in 14 abstinent alcoholics and 11 control subjects. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and plasma levels of the radioligand [I-123]$\beta$-CIT were used to quantify DAT protein availability. Individuals with the 9-repeat/10-repeat genotype had a mean 22{\%} reduction of DAT protein availability in putamen compared with 10-repeat homozygous individuals (t = 2.14, df = 23, p {\textless} .05). Consistent with earlier studies, alcoholism, per se, was not significantly associated with either DAT availability or DAT genotype. These findings suggest that the VNTR polymorphism of the DAT gene effects translation of the DAT protein. This effect may explain a variety of clinical associations that have been reported with this polymorphism. Copyright (C) 2000 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel beamforming approach for estimating event-related potential (ERP) source time series based on regularized linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The optimization problems in LDA and linearly-constrained minimum-variance (LCMV) beamformers are formally equivalent. The approaches differ in that, in LCMV beamformers, the spatial patterns are derived from a source model, whereas in an LDA beamformer the spatial patterns are derived directly from the data (i.e., the ERP peak). Using a formal proof and MEG simulations, we show that the LDA beamformer is robust to correlated sources and offers a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the LCMV beamformer and PCA. As an application, we use EEG data from an oddball experiment to show how the LDA beamformer can be harnessed to detect single-trial ERP latencies and estimate connectivity between ERP sources. Concluding, the LDA beamformer optimally reconstructs ERP sources by maximizing the ERP signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, it is a highly suited tool for analyzing ERP source time series, particularly in EEG/MEG studies wherein a source model is not available.},

abstract = {Neuronal oscillations have been shown to underlie various cognitive, perceptual and motor functions in the brain. However, studying these oscillations is notoriously difficult with EEG/MEG recordings due to a massive overlap of activity from multiple sources and also due to the strong background noise. Here we present a novel method for the reliable and fast extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel EEG/MEG/LFP recordings. The method is based on a linear decomposition of recordings: it maximizes the signal power at a peak frequency while simultaneously minimizing it at the neighboring, surrounding frequency bins. Such procedure leads to the optimization of signal-to-noise ratio and allows extraction of components with a characteristic "peaky" spectral profile, which is typical for oscillatory processes. We refer to this method as spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD). Our simulations demonstrate that the method allows extraction of oscillatory signals even with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 1:10. The SSD also outperformed conventional approaches based on independent component analysis. Using real EEG data we also show that SSD allows extraction of neuronal oscillations (e.g., in alpha frequency range) with high signal-to-noise ratio and with the spatial patterns corresponding to central and occipito-parietal sources. Importantly, running time for SSD is only a few milliseconds, which clearly distinguishes it from other extraction techniques usually requiring minutes or even hours of computational time. Due to the high accuracy and speed, we suggest that SSD can be used as a reliable method for the extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel electrophysiological recordings. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

It examines some complications in allocating resources between the two, particularly those introduced by the distribution of costs and benefits across time and space, and the effects of ecological interaction. Two general situations involving the development and used of knowledge in organizations are modeled. The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run. The possibility that certain common organizational practices ameliorate that tendency is assessed.},

@article{AlonsoBacigalupe2010a,
abstract = {This article offers a general overview of a wider experimental research project on simultaneous interpretation (SI). Contrary to previous assumptions, the results suggest that when working from English to Spanish, both lexical and syntactical forms, as well as automaticity, play a more than substantial role in the choices made by interpreters, rather than being systematically dictated by the underlying meaning of the original utterances. The experimental data appear to corroborate several intuitions already put forward by other researchers, further allowing for the identification of a series of highly specific and previously unknown interpreters' strategies, as well as flows of interferences. These results led to the formulation of a tentative model of information processing during SI, suggesting the concurrent interplay of three complementary and overlapping systems: literalness, automatic responses and meaning construction. This new proposal is not without consequences for many of the pillars of the profession, by re-opening the debate surrounding aspects such as language specificity and directionality, literalness, issues related to interpreting to or from one's first language, etc. This proposal may therefore have implications for interpreter training and for the future developments of the profession.

abstract = {Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a part of the brain's limbic system. Classically, this region has been related to affect, on the basis of lesion studies in humans and in animals. In the late 1980s, neuroimaging research indicated that ACC was active in many studies of cognition. The findings from EEG studies of a focal area of negativity in scalp electrodes following an error response led to the idea that ACC might be the brain's error detection and correction device. In this article, these various findings are reviewed in relation to the idea that ACC is a part of a circuit involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing. Neuroimaging studies showing that separate areas of ACC are involved in cognition and emotion are discussed and related to results showing that the error negativity is influenced by affect and motivation. In addition, the development of the emotional and cognitive roles of ACC are discussed, and how the success of this regulation in controlling responses might be correlated with cingulate size. Finally, some theories are considered about how the different subdivisions of ACC might interact with other cortical structures as a part of the circuits involved in the regulation of mental and emotional activity.},

The multiple correlation coefficients (R) were .84 (p {\textless} .01) and .68 (p {\textless} .01) for words and nonwords, respectively. The analyses revealed that some variables were clearly better predictors than others; and that many variables could be discarded with little cost in terms of reducing the multiple R.

abstract = {Age-related memory impairment occurs in many mammalian species, including humans. Moreover,womenundergoing the menopausal transition often complain of problems with memory. We recently reported that rhesus monkeys display age- and menopause-related recognition memory impairment on a hippocampus-reliant test [delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS)]. In the same monkeys, perforated synapse densities in the dentate gyrus outer molecular layer (OML) correlated with DNMS recognition accuracy, while total axospinous synapse density was similar across age and menses groups. The current study examined whether synaptic characteristics of OML axonal boutons are coupled with age- or menopause-related memory deficits. Using serial section electron microscopy, we measured the frequencies of single-synapse boutons (SSBs), multiple-synapse boutons (MSBs), and boutons with no apparent synaptic contacts [nonsynaptic boutons (NSBs)]  in the OML. Aged females had double the percentage of NSBs compared with young females, and this mea sure correlated positively and inversely with DNMS acquisition (number of trials to criterion) and delay performance (average accuracy), respectively. Aged compared with young females also had a lower frequency of MSBs and a lower number of synaptic contacts per MSB, and the latter variable inversely correlated withDNMSacquisition. Although proportions of NSBs, SSBs, and MSBs were similar across menses groups, compared with premenopausal monkeys, peri/postmenopausal monkeys had fewer MSBs contacting one or more segmented perforated synapses, and the abundance of this bouton subtype positively correlated with DNMS performance. These results suggest that age- and menopause-related shifts inOMLsynaptic subtypesmaybe coupled with deficits in task acquisition and recognition memory. {\textcopyright} 2011 the authors.},

abstract = {Cortical excitability changes induced by tDCS and revealed by TMS, are increasingly being used as an index of neuronal plasticity in the human cortex. The aim of this paper is to summarize the partially adverse effects of 567 tDCS sessions over motor and non-motor cortical areas (occipital, temporal, parietal) from the last 2 years, on work performed in our laboratories. One-hundred and two of our subjects who participated in our tDCS studies completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained rating scales regarding the presence and severity of headache, difficulties in concentrating, acute mood changes, visual perceptual changes and any discomforting sensation like pain, tingling, itching or burning under the electrodes, during and after tDCS. Participants were healthy subjects (75.5{\%}), migraine patients (8.8{\%}), post-stroke patients (5.9{\%}) and tinnitus patients (9.8{\%}). During tDCS a mild tingling sensation was the most common reported adverse effect (70.6{\%}), moderate fatigue was felt by 35.3{\%} of the subjects, whereas a light itching sensation under the stimulation electrodes occurred in 30.4{\%} of cases. After tDCS headache (11.8{\%}), nausea (2.9{\%}) and insomnia (0.98{\%}) were reported, but fairly infrequently. In addition, the incidence of the itching sensation (p = 0.02) and the intensity of tingling sensation (p = 0.02) were significantly higher during tDCS in the group of the healthy subjects, in comparison to patients; whereas the occurrence of headache was significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.03) after the stimulation. Our results suggest that tDCS applied to motor and non-motor areas according to the present tDCS safety guidelines, is associated with relatively minor adverse effects in healthy humans and patients with varying neurological disorders. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {There is considerable evidence that fluent bilinguals suffer a certain degree of cross-language interference, which varies according to age of language acquisition, linguistic proficiency, and as words become more orthographically, phonologically and semantically similar. We studied and compared early bilinguals, simultaneous interpreters and monolingual controls to disentangle the effect of age of language acquisition from that of fluency, in the functional organization of the multilingual brain. The data suggest that a certain degree of interference takes place in the context of multiple languages because of the parallel access to different linguistic systems. There is less interference if one of the languages has a special status. Age of acquisition seems to be more relevant than proficiency in determining a different linguistic cerebral organization between monolinguals and polyglots. It appears that the linguistic systems (L1, L2, L3, etc.), are not independent but rather are based on a common conceptual system. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments. PsychoPy can also generate movies and image sequences to be used in demos or simulated neuroscience experiments.

abstract = {One of the challenges in modeling cognitive events from electroencephalogram (EEG) data is finding representations that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences, as well as to inherent noise associated with such data. Herein, we propose a novel approach for learning such representations from multi-channel EEG time-series, and demonstrate its advantages in the context of mental load classification task. First, we transform EEG activities into a sequence of topology-preserving multi-spectral images, as opposed to standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such spatial information. Next, we train a deep recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art video classification to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. The proposed approach is designed to preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal structure of EEG which leads to finding features that are less sensitive to variations and distortions within each dimension. Empirical evaluation on the cognitive load classification task demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy over current state-of-the-art approaches in this field.},

abstract = {The way that we interpret and interact with the world entails making decisions on the basis of available sensory evidence. Recent primate neurophysiology [1-6], human neuroimaging [7-13], and modeling experiments [14-19] have demonstrated that perceptual decisions are based on an integrative process in which sensory evidence accumulates over time until an internal decision bound is reached. Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to provide causal support for the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in this integrative process. Specifically, we used a speeded perceptual categorization task designed to induce a time-dependent accumulation of sensory evidence through rapidly updating dynamic stimuli and found that disruption of the left DLPFC with low-frequency rTMS reduced accuracy and increased response times relative to a sham condition. Importantly, using the drift-diffusion model, we show that these behavioral effects correspond to a decrease in drift rate, a parameter describing the rate and thereby the efficiency of the sensory evidence integration in the decision process. These results provide causal evidence linking the DLPFC to the mechanism of evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

They can be recorded noninvasively from almost any group of research participants, and they can provide information about a broad range of cognitive and affective processes. Consequently, the ERP technique has become a common tool in almost all areas of psychological research, and students and researchers must be able to understand and evaluate ERP studies in the literature. However, these studies often involve a set of terms and concepts that are unfamiliar to many psychologists; sev- eral technical issues must be understood before a student or researcher can read and evaluate ERP studies. The goal of this chapter is to provide students and researchers with this background information so that they can be informed con- sumers of ERP studies in their area of interest.

To date, however, fewer studies have examined the origins of these biases. Here, we review previous work demonstrating that human economic biases such as loss aversion and reference dependence are shared with an ancestrally related New World primate, the capuchin monkey (Cebus apella). We then examine whether capuchins display an endowment effect in a token-trading task. We identified pairs of treats (fruit discs versus cereal chunks) that were equally preferred by each monkey. When given a chance to trade away their owned fruit discs to obtain the equally valued cereal chunks (or vice versa), however, monkeys required a far greater compensation than the equally preferred treat. We show that these effects are not due to transaction costs or timing issues. These data suggest that biased preferences rely on cognitive systems that are more evolutionarily ancient than previously thought-and that common evolutionary ancestry shared by humans and capuchins may account for the occurrence of the endowment effect in both species.},

Flanker effects were observed for sentence final words on electrophysiological measures during the reading task and on subsequent recognition memory performance for sentence final and new words. For both measures, the flanker effect interacted with the congruency of the sentence ending as well as the visual angle between the sentence final word and its flanker. The largest and earliest flanker effects were observed for congruent endings at the smallest visual angle (0.57 degrees); congruent endings and flankers in intermediate visual angle (0.97 degrees) conditions displayed a similar flanker-related negativity but with a longer onset latency (490 vs. 280 ms). Congruent endings and their flankers in the largest visual angle (1.57 degrees) conditions revealed no flanker effect.},

abstract = {It is generally thought that transmitter release at mammalian central synapses is triggered by Ca2+ microdomains, implying loose coupling between presynaptic Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ sensors of exocytosis. Here we show that Ca2+ channel subunit immunoreactivity is highly concentrated in the active zone of GABAergic presynaptic terminals of putative parvalbumin-containing basket cells in the hippocampus. Paired recording combined with presynaptic patch pipette perfusion revealed that GABA release at basket cell-granule cell synapses is sensitive to millimolar concentrations of the fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA but insensitive to the slow Ca2+ chelator EGTA. These results show that Ca2+ source and Ca2+ sensor are tightly coupled at this synapse, with distances in the range of 10-20 nm. Models of Ca2+ inflow-exocytosis coupling further reveal that the tightness of coupling increases efficacy, speed, and temporal precision of transmitter release. Thus, tight coupling contributes to fast feedforward and feedback inhibition in the hippocampal network. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Furthermore, the significance of the translator's competence in the target language is explained with state-of-the-art knowledge in the field. In section 1 the axiom of the native speaker superiority axiom is presented and actors responsible for promoting it are identified, including: translator trainers, the EU, the translator community. Section 2 reviews several current publications in Translation Studies in an attempt to provide a state-of-the art understanding of how translation is done and what implications the translator's target language may have. In section 3, the reader's attention is shifted to the notions which have strong implications for the translation classroom and help see L2 translation in a demystified manner: translation competence, knowledge integration network and translator as an expert learner.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the current literature on individual differences in susceptibility to the effects of background sound on visual-verbal task performance. A large body of evidence suggests that individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) underpin individual differences in susceptibility to auditory distraction in most tasks and contexts. Specifically, high WMC is associated with a more steadfast locus of attention (thus overruling the call for attention that background noise may evoke) and a more constrained auditory-sensory gating (i.e., less processing of the background sound). The relation between WMC and distractibility is a general framework that may also explain distractibility differences between populations that differ along variables that covary with WMC (such as age, developmental disorders, and personality traits). A neurocognitive task-engagement/distraction trade-off (TEDTOFF) model that summarizes current knowledge is outlined and directions for future research are proposed.},

abstract = {Is visual attention required for visual consciousness? In the past decade, many researchers have claimed that awareness can arise in the absence of attention. This claim is largely based on the notion that natural scene (or "gist") perception occurs without attention. This article presents evidence against this idea. We show that when observers perform a variety of demanding, sustained-attention tasks, inattentional blindness occurs for natural scenes. In addition, scene perception is impaired under dual-task conditions, but only when the primary task is sufficiently demanding. This finding suggests that previous studies that have been interpreted as demonstrating scene perception without attention failed to fully engage attention and that natural-scene perception does indeed require attention. Thus, natural-scene perception is not a preattentive process and cannot be used to support the idea of awareness without attention.},

abstract = {Research integrating neuroimaging and molecular genetics has yielded important insights into how variability in brain chemistry predicts individual differences in brain function, behavior and related risk for psychopathology. However, existing studies have been limited by their focus on the independent effects of single polymorphisms with modest impact on brain chemistry. Here, we explored the effects of five functional polymorphisms affecting dopamine (DA) signaling on reward-related ventral striatum (VS) reactivity, measured with BOLD fMRI, in a sample of 69 Caucasians. We also compiled individual multilocus genetic profile scores reflecting the additive effects of alleles conferring relatively increased DA signaling across the five polymorphic loci: DAT1 9-repeat, DRD4 7-repeat, DRD2 -141C Del, DRD2 Taq1A C (A2), and COMT (158)Met. These multilocus DA profile scores accounted for 10.9{\%} of the inter-individual variability in reward-related VS reactivity. In contrast, none of the individual polymorphisms accounted for significant variability. Our results show that biologically informed multilocus genetic profiles have unique promise as indices of variability in brain chemistry that may yield advances in mapping individual differences in behaviorally relevant brain function. In turn, such genetic profiles may fuel gene-environment interactions research establishing trajectories of risk for psychopathology.},

abstract = {Sensory processing is affected by both endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of attention, although how these mechanisms interact in the brain has remained unclear. In the present study, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how multiple stages of information processing in the brain are affected when endogenous and exogenous mechanisms are concurrently engaged. We found that the earliest stage of cortical visual processing, the striate-cortex-generated C1, was immune to attentional modulation, even when endogenous and exogenous attention converged on a common location. The earliest stage of processing to be affected in this experiment was the late phase of the extrastriate-cortex-generated P1 component, which was dominated by exogenous attention. Processing at this stage was enhanced by exogenous attention, regardless of where endogenous attention had been oriented. Endogenous attention, however, dominated a later, higher-order stage of processing indexed by an enhancement of the P300 that was unaffected by exogenous attention. Critically, between these early and late stages, an interaction was found wherein endogenous and exogenous attention produced distinct, and overlapping, effects on information processing. At the same time that exogenous attention was producing an extended enhancement of the late-P1, endogenous attention was enhancing the occipital-parietal N1 component. These results provide neurophysiological support for theories suggesting that endogenous and exogenous mechanisms represent two attention systems that can affect information processing in the brain in distinct ways. Furthermore, these data provide new evidence regarding the precise stages of neural processing that are, and are not, affected when endogenous and exogenous attentions interact. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular analysis suggests that this tight coupling is generated by protein-protein interactions involving Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) sensors and various other synaptic proteins.

Twenty-one interpreting strategies were identified; a detailed classification and examples of relevant protocol fragments are presented.

abstract = {Although the resting and baseline states of the human electroencephalogram and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) are dominated by oscillations in the alpha band (approximately 10 Hz), the functional role of these oscillations remains unclear. In this study we used MEG to investigate how spontaneous oscillations in humans presented before visual stimuli modulate visual perception. Subjects had to report if there was a subtle difference in gray levels between two superimposed presented discs. We then compared the prestimulus brain activity for correctly (hits) versus incorrectly (misses) identified stimuli. We found that visual discrimination ability decreased with an increase in prestimulus alpha power. Given that reaction times did not vary systematically with prestimulus alpha power changes in vigilance are not likely to explain the change in discrimination ability. Source reconstruction using spatial filters allowed us to identify the brain areas accounting for this effect. The dominant sources modulating visual perception were localized around the parieto-occipital sulcus. We suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha power reflects functional inhibition imposed by higher level areas, which serves to modulate the gain of the visual stream.},

abstract = {Two dichotic listening experiments were performed in which stimulus and task conditions were optimized for the early selection of inputs. Subjects listened selectively to sequences of rapidly presented tone pips in one ear while ignoring tone pips of a different pitch in the opposite ear. In both experiments, an enhanced positivity between 20 and 50 msec (the 'P20-50') was observed over central and frontal sites in the ERPs to the attended-channel tone pips. At longer latencies, the effects of attention appeared to include an amplitude modulation of several exogenous ERPs, including subcomponents of the central N1 (60-150 msec) and P2 (170-230 msec) waves and the temporal T complex (80-150 msec). In contrast, the attention effect prefrontally consisted of a broad negativity that appeared to be largely endogenous. A signal processing technique (Adjar) was employed to correct for distortion of mutually overlapping ERPs elicited by successive stimuli presented at short interstimulus intervals (ISIs). It was confirmed that the P20-50 attention effect was not the result of differential overlap from previous ERPs. In addition, this technique allowed an analysis to be made of the effects of the preceding stimulus type and ISI on the attention-sensitive ERPs, which provided further support for the view that highly focused selective attention can directly modulate exogenous components of the auditory ERP. Moreover, these sequence-dependent ERP modulations were paralleled by variations in target discrimination performance. Taken together, these results provide strong support for the early selection hypothesis that attention can serve to selectively bias or gate stimulus processing before full perceptual analysis has occurred. ?? 1991.},

Visual search experiments capture aspects of this process, by having subjects look for a target within a background of distractors. Search speed often correlates with target-distractor discriminability; search is faster when the target and distractors look quite different. However, there are notable exceptions. A given discriminability can yield efficient searches (where the target seems to "pop-out") as well as inefficient ones (where additional distractors make search significantly slower and more difficult). Search is often more difficult when finding the target requires distinguishing a particular configuration or conjunction of features. Search asymmetries abound. These puzzling results have fueled three decades of theoretical and experimental studies. We argue that the key issue in search is the processing of image patches in the periphery, where visual representation is characterized by summary statistics computed over a sizable pooling region. By quantifying these statistics, we predict a set of classic search results, as well as peripheral discriminability of crowded patches such as those found in search displays.},

abstract = {1. The effect of parvalbumin (PV) on [Ca 2+ ] transients was investigated by perfusing adrenal chromaffin cells with fura-2 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled PV. As PV diffused into cells, the decay of [Ca 2+ ] transients was transformed from monophasic into biphasic. The proportion of the initial fast decay phase increased in parallel with the fluorescence intensity of FITC, indicating that PV is responsible for the initial fast decay phase. 2. The relationship between the fast decay phase and the [Ca 2+ ] level was investigated using depolarizing trains of stimuli. Within a train the relative amplitude of the fast decay phase was inversely dependent on the [Ca 2+ ] level preceding a given stimulus. 3. Based on these observations, we estimated the Ca 2+ binding ratio of PV ($\kappa$(P)), the apparent dissociation constant of PV for Ca 2+ (K(dc,app)), and the unbinding rate constant of Ca 2+ from PV (k(c-)) in the cytosol of chromaffin cells. Assuming free [Mg 2+ ] to be 0.14 mM, we obtained values of 51.4 ± 2.0 nM (n = 3) and 0.95 ± 0.026 s -1 (n = 3), for K(dc,app) and k(c-), respectively. 4. With the parameters obtained in the perfusion study, we simulated [Ca 2+ ] transients, using two different Ca 2+ extrusion rates ($\gamma$) - 20 and 300 s -1 - which represent typical values for chromaffin cells and neuronal dendrites, respectively. The simulation indicated that Ca 2+ is pumped out before it is equilibrated with PV, when $\gamma$ is comparable to the equilibration rates between PV and Ca 2+ , resulting in the fast decay phase of a biexponential [Ca 2+ ] transient. 5. From these results we conclude that Ca 2+ buffers with slow kinetics, such as PV, may cause biexponential decays in [Ca 2+ ] transients, thereby complicating the analysis of endogenous Ca 2+ binding ratios ($\kappa$(S)) based on time constants. Nevertheless, estimates of $\kappa$(S) based on Ca 2+ increments provide reasonable estimates for Ca 2+ binding ratios before equilibration with PV.},

abstract = {Attention and arousal are multi-dimensional psychological processes, which interact closely with one another. The neural substrates of attention, as well as the interaction between arousal and attention, are discussed in this review. After a brief discussion of psychological and neuropsychological theories of attention, event-related potential correlates of attention are discussed. Essentially, attention acts to modulate stimulus-induced electrical potentials (N100/P100, P300, N400), rather than generating any unique potentials of its own. Functional neuroimaging studies of attentional orienting, selective attention, divided attention and sustained attention (and its inter-dependance on underlying levels of arousal) are then reviewed. A distinction is drawn between the brain areas which are crucially involved in the top-down modulation of attention (the 'sources' of attention) and those sensory-association areas whose activity is modulated by attention (the 'sites' of attentional expression). Frontal and parietal (usually right- lateralised) cortices and thalamus are most often associated with the source of attentional modulation. Also, the use of functional neuroimaging to test explicit hypotheses about psychological theories of attention is emphasised. These experimental paradigms form the basis for a 'new generation' of functional imaging studies which exploit the dynamic aspect of imaging and demonstrate how it can be used as more than just a 'brain mapping' device. Finally, a review of psychopharmacological studies in healthy human volunteers outlines the contributions of the noradrenergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems to the neurochemical modulation of human attention and arousal. While, noradrenergic and cholinergic systems are involved in 'low-level' aspects of attention (e.g. attentional orienting), the dopaminergic system is associated with more 'executive' aspects of attention such as attentional set-shifting or working memory.},

abstract = {Spoken word recognition and production require fast transformations between acoustic, phonological, and conceptual neural representations. Bilinguals perform these transformations in native and non-native languages, deriving unified semantic concepts from equivalent, but acoustically different words. Here we exploit this capacity of bilinguals to investigate input invariant semantic representations in the brain. We acquired EEG data while Dutch subjects, highly proficient in English listened to four monosyllabic and acoustically distinct animal words in both languages (e.g., "paard"-"horse"). Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was applied to identify EEG response patterns that discriminate between individual words within one language (within-language discrimination) and generalize meaning across two languages (across-language generalization). Furthermore, employing two EEG feature selection approaches, we assessed the contribution of temporal and oscillatory EEG features to our classification results. MVPA revealed that within-language discrimination was possible in a broad time-window ({\~{}}50-620 ms) after word onset probably reflecting acoustic-phonetic and semantic-conceptual differences between the words. Most interestingly, significant across-language generalization was possible around 550-600 ms, suggesting the activation of common semantic-conceptual representations from the Dutch and English nouns. Both types of classification, showed a strong contribution of oscillations below 12 Hz, indicating the importance of low frequency oscillations in the neural representation of individual words and concepts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of MVPA to decode individual spoken words from EEG responses and to assess the spectro-temporal dynamics of their language invariant semantic-conceptual representations. We discuss how this method and results could be relevant to track the neural mechanisms underlying conceptual encoding in comprehension and production.},

abstract = {The modern study of perception began when Fechner published his 'Elements of Psychophysics' in 1860. This book has guided most perception research ever since. It has become increasingly clear that there are problems with Fechner's approach, which assumes that the percept is completely determined by the sensory input. Fechner's approach cannot explain the processes that allow our percepts to be veridical. Post-Fechnerian schools (Helmholtzian, Structural, Gestalt and Gibsonian) have tried to deal with this problem, but have not been successful. An alternative to the Fechnerian approach is required. This paper describes an alternative that has been developing over the last 20 years within the computer vision community. It treats perceptual interpretation as a solution of an inverse problem that depends critically on the operation of a priori constraints. Contemporary research, which adopted this approach, has concentrated on verifying the usefulness of Bayesian and standard regularization methods. This paper takes the next step; it discusses theoretical and empirical aspects of studying human perception as an inverse problem. It reviews the literature that illustrates the power of the inverse problem approach. This review leads to the suggestion that progress in the study of perception will benefit if the inverse approach were to be adopted by experimentalists, as well as by the computational modelers, who have been actively exploring its potential to date. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Over the years, this has been successful in giving an integrated account not only of data from normal adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Humans have an unparalleled ability to represent objects as members of multiple categories. A given object, such as a pillow may be-depending on current task demands-represented as an instance of something that is soft, as something that contains feathers, as something that is found in bedrooms, or something that is larger than a toaster. This type of processing requires the individual to dynamically highlight task-relevant properties and abstract over or suppress object properties that, although salient, are not relevant to the task at hand. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological evidence suggests that this ability may depend on cognitive control processes associated with the left inferior prefrontal gyrus. Here, we show that stimulating the left inferior frontal cortex using transcranial direct current stimulation alters performance of healthy subjects on a simple categorization task. Our task required subjects to select pictures matching a description, e.g., "click on all the round things." Cathodal stimulation led to poorer performance on classification trials requiring attention to specific dimensions such as color or shape as opposed to trials that required selecting items belonging to a more thematic category such as objects that hold water. A polarity reversal (anodal stimulation) lowered the threshold for selecting items that were more weakly associated with the target category. These results illustrate the role of frontally-mediated control processes in categorization and suggest potential interactions between categorization, cognitive control, and language.},

abstract = {The properties of linguistic attention were examined by recording event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to probe stimuli mixed with dichotically presented prose passages. Subjects either shadowed (repeated phrase by phrase) or selectively listened to one passage while ERPs were recorded from electrodes overlying midline sites, left-hemisphere speech areas, and corresponding areas of the right hemisphere. Mixed with each voice (a male voice in one ear, a female voice in the other) were four probe stimuli: digitized speech sounds (but or /a/ as in father) produced by the same speaker and tone bursts at the mean fundamental and second formant frequencies of that voice. The ERPs elicited by the speech probes in the attended ear showed an enhanced negativity, with an onset at 50 ms-100 ms and lasting up to 800 ms-1,000 ms, whereas the ERPs to the second formant probes showed an enhanced positivity in the 200 ms-300 ms latency range. These effects were comparable for shadowing and selective listening conditions and remained stable over the course of the experiment. The attention-related negativity to the consonant-vowel-consonant probe (but) was most prominent over the left hemisphere; other probes produced no significant asymmetries. The results indicate that stimulus selection during linguistic attention is specifically tuned to speech sounds rather than simply to constituent pure-tone frequencies or ear of entry. Furthermore, it appears that both attentional set and stimulus characteristics can influence the hemispheric utilization of stimuli.},

If training could enhance change detection performance in general, then it might help to remedy some real-world consequences of change blindness (e.g. failing to detect hazards while driving). We examined whether adaptive training on a simple change detection task could improve the ability to detect changes in untrained tasks for young and older adults. Consistent with an effective training procedure, both young and older adults were better able to detect changes to trained objects following training. However, neither group showed differential improvement on untrained change detection tasks when compared to active control groups. Change detection training led to improvements on the trained task but did not generalize to other change detection tasks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Meinzer2013,
abstract = {Introduction: Recently, growing interest emerged in the enhancement of human potential by means of non-invasive brain stimulation. In particular, anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) has been shown to exert beneficial effects on motor and higher cognitive functions. However, the majority of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) studies have assessed effects of single stimulation sessions that are mediated by transient neural modulation. Studies assessing the impact of multiple stimulation sessions on learning that may induce long-lasting behavioural and neural changes are scarce and have not yet been accomplished in the language domain in healthy individuals. Method: The present study probed the potential of atDCS to enhance language learning over multiple days by employing an explicit word learning paradigm. Forty healthy young participants were randomized to learning with either simultaneous atDCS or sham stimulation (N = 20/group; comparable regarding demographic variables and neurocognitive status). All participants acquired a novel vocabulary (familiar and novel object picture - non-word pairs) over five consecutive days. Two memory tasks (free recall; forced choice recognition tasks) were administered immediately after each training session. A one week follow-up tested the maintenance of learning success. Results: Linear mixed effects model analysis revealed superior learning during atDCS compared to sham stimulation for both familiar and novel objects. atDCS yielded a steeper learning curve and significantly more pronounced learning at the end of the training during the recall task. During the recognition task, the atDCS group reached ceiling levels earlier and overall learning success was greater. For both tasks, beneficial atDCS effects were maintained during the follow-up assessment. Conclusions: The present study provides direct evidence that atDCS administered during multiple learning sessions facilitates language learning and that effects are maintained over time. This study contributes important novel information about the extent of stimulation effects in the healthy brain, thereby highlighting the potential of atDCS to enhance language recovery after stroke. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Summary A point at issue in simultaneous interpreting is the time lag between the speaker of the original and the interpreter. The length of the time lag depends on objective and subjective factors. The objective factors can be described in linguistic terms and are something for the interpreter to go by when timing the moment of transposition. However, the optimum time lag between hearing and interpreting rests also on subjective factors arising from the individuality of the interpreter. An examination of the problem involved in the time lag leads us to a number of well-grounded conclusions of relevance to methodological simultaneous interpreting.},

abstract = {Calcium is an ambivalent signal: it is essential for the correct functioning of cell life, but may also become dangerous to it. The plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) and the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) are the two mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ extrusion. The NCX has low Ca2+ affinity but high capacity for Ca2+ transport, whereas the PMCA has a high Ca2+ affinity but low transport capacity for it. Thus, traditionally, the PMCA pump has been attributed a housekeeping role in maintaining cytosolic Ca2+, and the NCX the dynamic role of counteracting large cytosolic Ca2+ variations (especially in excitable cells). This view of the roles of the two Ca2+ extrusion systems has been recently revised, as the specific functional properties of the numerous PMCA isoforms and splicing variants suggests that they may have evolved to cover both the basal Ca2+ regulation (in the 100 nM range) and the Ca2+ transients generated by cell stimulation (in the mM range).},

The reconfiguration speed that is currently available today is somehow artificially limited by the FPGA vendors, while the fabrication process technologies used for building the latest devices today are capable of achieving much higher reconfiguration speed. In this paper we will present a new design and implementation method for achieving high speed partial run-time reconfiguration that exceeds the specified reconfiguration speed of today's FPGAs. By adding custom logic around the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP) to implement an enhanced ICAP hard macro, we will investigate the partial run-time reconfiguration speed and explore the limits of the ICAP interface. This is done by using over clocking of the ICAP. Compared with previously work on high-speed reconfiguration, using the enhanced ICAP hard macro will significantly increase the reconfiguration speed.},

Indeed, such articulation artifacts are typically much larger than the brain signal of interest. Recently, a Blind Source Separation technique based on Canonical Correlation Analysis was proposed to separate tonic muscle artifacts from continuous EEG recordings in epilepsy. In this paper, we show how the same algorithm can be adapted to remove the short EMG bursts due to articulation on every trial. Several analyses indicate that this method accurately attenuates the muscle contamination on the EEG recordings, providing to the neurolinguistic community a powerful tool to investigate the brain processes at play during overt language production.},

@article{Miran2018,
abstract = {Humans are able to identify and track a target speaker amid a cacophony of acoustic interference, which is often referred to as the cocktail party phenomenon. Results from several decades of studying this phenomenon have culminated in recent years in various promising attempts to decode the attentional state of a listener in a competing-speaker environment from non-invasive neuroimaging recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, most existing approaches compute correlation-based measures by either regressing the features of each speech stream to the M/EEG channels (the decoding approach) or vice versa (the encoding approach). These procedures operate in an offline fashion, i.e., require the entire duration of the experiment and multiple trials to provide robust results. Therefore, they cannot be used in emerging applications such as smart hearing aid devices, where a single trial must be used in real-time to decode the attentional state. In this paper, we close this gap by developing an algorithmic pipeline for real-time decoding of the attentional state. Our proposed framework consists of three main modules: 1) Real-time and robust estimation of encoding or decoding coefficients, achieved by sparse adaptive filtering, 2) Extracting reliable markers of the attentional state, and thereby generalizing the widely-used correlation-based measures thereof, and 3) Devising a near real-time state-space estimator that translates the noisy and variable attention markers to robust and reliable estimates of the attentional state with minimal delay. Our proposed algorithms integrate various techniques including forgetting factor-based adaptive filtering, l 1-regularization, forward-backward splitting algorithms, fixed-lag smoothing, and Expectation Maximization. We validate the performance of our proposed framework using comprehensive simulations as well as application to experimentally acquired M/EEG data. Our results reveal that the proposed real-time algorithms perform nearly as accurate as the existing state-of-the-art offline techniques, while providing a significant degree of adaptivity, statistical robustness, and computational savings.},

One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

abstract = {In a sample of 10 professionals interpreting the same source speech in the simultaneous mode, errors and omissions (e/o's) were found to affect different source-speech seg- ments, and a large proportion among them were only made by a small proportion of the subjects. In a repeat performance, there were some new e/o's in the second version when the same interpreters had interpreted the same segments correctly in the first version. These findings strengthen the Effort Models' “tightrope hypothesis” that many e/o's are due not to the intrinsic difficulty of the corresponding source-speech segments, but to the interpreters working close to processing capacity saturation, which makes them vulnerable to even small variations in the available processing capacity for each interpreting component.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a simple statistical method for extracting target source activities from spatio-temporal source activities reconstructed from MEG measurements. The method requires measurements in a control condition, which contains only non-target source activities. The method derives, at each pixel location, an empirical probability distribution of the non-target source activity using the time course reconstruction obtained from the control period. The statistical threshold that can extract the target source activities is derived from the empirical distributions obtained from all pixel locations. Here, the multiple comparison problem is addressed with a two-step procedure involving standardizing these empirical distributions and deriving an empirical distribution of the maximum pseudo T value at each pixel location. The results of applying the proposed method to auditory-evoked measurements are presented to demonstrate the method's effectiveness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Frequency tagging of sensory inputs (presenting stimuli that fluctuate periodically at rates to which the cortex can phase lock) has been used to study attentional modulation of neural responses to inputs in different sensory modalities. For visual inputs, the visual steady-state response (VSSR) at the frequency modulating an attended object is enhanced, while the VSSR to a distracting object is suppressed. In contrast, the effect of attention on the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is inconsistent across studies. However, most auditory studies analyzed results at the sensor level or used only a small number of equivalent current dipoles to fit cortical responses. In addition, most studies of auditory spatial attention used dichotic stimuli (independent signals at the ears) rather than more natural, binaural stimuli. Here, we asked whether these methodological choices help explain discrepant results. Listeners attended to one of two competing speech streams, one simulated from the left and one from the right, that were modulated at different frequencies. Using distributed source modeling of magnetoencephalography results, we estimate how spatially directed attention modulates the ASSR in neural regions across the whole brain. Attention enhances the ASSR power at the frequency of the attended stream in contralateral auditory cortex. The attended-stream modulation frequency also drives phase-locked responses in the left (but not right) precentral sulcus (lPCS), a region implicated in control of eye gaze and visual spatial attention. Importantly, this region shows no phase locking to the distracting stream. Results suggest that the lPCS in engaged in an attention-specific manner. Modeling results that take account of the geometry and phases of the cortical sources phase locked to the two streams (including hemispheric asymmetry of lPCS activity) help to explain why past ASSR studies of auditory spatial attention yield seemingly contradictory results.},

abstract = {The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is a 30 item self-report instrument designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. Originally developed as part of a larger attempt to relate anxiety and impulsiveness to psychomotor efficiency, the BIS is arguably the most commonly administered self-report measure for the assessment of impulsiveness in both research and clinical settings. Over the last 50 years the BIS has significantly influenced the way that impulsivity is conceptualized in psychology and psychiatry. On its golden anniversary we thought it important to update the literature in relation to this influential psychometric instrument. The goal of this paper is threefold: (1) describe the history and development of the BIS-11; (2) present new data supporting the psychometric properties of the subscales; and to (3) review the clinical and personality literature that has reported on the BIS-11 subscales. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Neuroelectric oscillations reflect rhythmic shifting of neuronal ensembles between high and low excitability states. In natural settings, important stimuli often occur in rhythmic streams, and when oscillations entrain to an input rhythm their high excitability phases coincide with events in the stream, effectively amplifying neuronal input responses. When operating in a 'rhythmic mode', attention can use these differential excitability states as a mechanism of selection by simply enforcing oscillatory entrainment to a task-relevant input stream. When there is no low-frequency rhythm that oscillations can entrain to, attention operates in a 'continuous mode', characterized by extended increase in gamma synchrony. We review the evidence for early sensory selection by oscillatory phase-amplitude modulations, its mechanisms and its perceptual and behavioral consequences. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjects were asked to select one of six fictitious cars, differing along several dimensions, for purchase. Persons who had been made to feel good by receiving feedback that they had succeeded on a prior task of perceptual-motor skills chose the same alternatives as did control subjects, but made their decisions more quickly. Positive-affect subjects were less likely than were control subjects to review information they had already looked at, and were more likely to ignore information considered unimportant. Analysis of subjects' protocols indicates that the groups differed in the strategies they used for reaching decisions. The positive-affect subjects were likely to use the strategy of "elimination by aspects" (eliminating from futher consideration alternatives that did not meet a criterion on a selected important dimension). The effect of positive affect upon decision making in this task is interpreted as an increase in efficiency.},

abstract = {A visual scene is perceived in terms of visual objects. Similar ideas have been proposed for the analogous case of auditory scene analysis, although their hypothesized neural underpinnings have not yet been established. Here, we address this question by recording from subjects selectively listening to one of two competing speakers, either of different or the same sex, using magnetoencephalography. Individual neural representations are seen for the speech of the two speakers, with each being selectively phase locked to the rhythm of the corresponding speech stream and from which can be exclusively reconstructed the temporal envelope of that speech stream. The neural representation of the attended speech dominates responses (with latency near 100 ms) in posterior auditory cortex. Furthermore, when the intensity of the attended and background speakers is separately varied over an 8-dB range, the neural representation of the attended speech adapts only to the intensity of that speaker but not to the intensity of the background speaker, suggesting an object-level intensity gain control. In summary, these results indicate that concurrent auditory objects, even if spectrotemporally overlapping and not resolvable at the auditory periphery, are neurally encoded individually in auditory cortex and emerge as fundamental representational units for top-down attentional modulation and bottom-up neural adaptation.},

abstract = {The attention effect on the auditory event-related potential (ERP) in dichotic conditions was studied as a function of the interstimulus interval (ISI). Subjects attended to stimuli delivered to a designated ear and responded to infrequent pitch deviants in this input. The mean ISI was either 80, 160, 480, or 800 ms. Negative difference waves (Nds) were computed by subtracting ERPs to unattended standards from ERPs to the same stimuli when attended. The exogenous N1, as estimated from unattended standard ERPs, was larger contralaterally to the stimulus and inverted in polarity at mastoids. With decreasing ISIs, N1 diminished in amplitude much faster than did the Nd. In addition, N1 latency remained stable, whereas Nd peaked markedly earlier with shorter ISIs, almost perfectly coinciding with the exogenous N1. However, this temporal coincidence found in grand averages proved to be illusory in single subjects. The early Nd showed no contralateral asymmetry at its peak, but asymmetry was apparent during the ascending slope. These lateral asymmetries resembled those of the exogenous N1 but occurred later. The early Nd peak was, at least mainly, caused by an endogenous attention effect, the processing negativity (PN), even with very short ISIs, but an effect on the exogenous N1 could not be excluded.},

abstract = {CA3-CA3 recurrent excitatory synapses are thought to play a key role in memory storage and pattern completion. Whether the plasticity properties of these synapses are consistent with their proposed network functions remains unclear. Here, we examine the properties of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at CA3-CA3 synapses. Low-frequency pairing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and action potentials (APs) induces long-term potentiation (LTP), independent of temporal order. The STDP curve is symmetric and broad (half-width ∼150 ms). Consistent with these STDP induction properties, AP-EPSP sequences lead to supralinear summation of spine [Ca2+] transients. Furthermore, afterdepolarizations (ADPs) following APs efficiently propagate into dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, and EPSPs summate with dendritic ADPs. In autoassociative network models, storage and recall are more robust with symmetric than with asymmetric STDP rules.

abstract = {In a dichotic listening paradigm, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to linguistic and nonlinguistic probe stimuli embedded in 2 different narrative contexts as they were either attended or unattended. In adults, the typical N1 attention effect was observed for both types of probes: Probes superimposed on the attended narrative elicited an enhanced negativity compared to the same probes when unattended. Overall, this sustained attention effect was greater over medial and left lateral sites, but was more posteriorly distributed and of longer duration for linguistic as compared to nonlinguistic probes. In contrast, in 6- to 8-year-old children the ERPs were morphologically dissimilar to those elicited in adults and children displayed a greater positivity to both types of probe stimuli when embedded in the attended as compared to the unattended narrative. Although both adults and children showed attention effects beginning at about 100 msec, only adults displayed left-lateralized attention effects and a distinct, posterior distribution for linguistic probes. These results suggest that the attentional networks indexed by this task continue to develop beyond the age of 8 years.},

abstract = {Cortical speech processing is dependent on the mutual interdependence of two distinctive processing streams supporting sound-to-meaning (i.e., ventral stream) and sound-to-articulation (i.e., dorsal stream) mapping. Here, we compared the strengths of intracranial functional connectivity between two main hubs of the dorsal stream, namely the left auditory-related cortex (ARC) and Broca's region, in a sample of simultaneous interpreters (SIs) and multilingual control subjects while the participants performed a mixed and unmixed auditory semantic decision task. Under normal listening conditions such kind of tasks are known to initiate a spread of activation along the ventral stream. However, due to extensive and specific training, here we predicted that SIs will more strongly recruit the dorsal pathway in order to pre-activate the speech codes of the corresponding translation. In line with this reasoning, EEG results demonstrate increased left-hemispheric theta phase synchronization in SLI compared to multilingual control subjects during early task-related processing stages. In addition, within the SI group functional connectivity strength in the left dorsal pathway was positively related to the cumulative number of training hours across lifespan, and inversely correlated with the age of training commencement. Hence, we propose that the alignment of neuronal oscillations between brain regions involved in “hearing” and “speaking” results from an intertwining of training, sensitive period, and predisposition.},

abstract = {Several recent works have shown how highly realistic human head images can be obtained by training convolutional neural networks to generate them. In order to create a personalized talking head model, these works require training on a large dataset of images of a single person. However, in many practical scenarios, such personalized talking head models need to be learned from a few image views of a person, potentially even a single image. Here, we present a system with such few-shot capability. It performs lengthy meta-learning on a large dataset of videos, and after that is able to frame few- and one-shot learning of neural talking head models of previously unseen people as adversarial training problems with high capacity generators and discriminators. Crucially, the system is able to initialize the parameters of both the generator and the discriminator in a person-specific way, so that training can be based on just a few images and done quickly, despite the need to tune tens of millions of parameters. We show that such an approach is able to learn highly realistic and personalized talking head models of new people and even portrait paintings.},

abstract = {The characteristics of stimuli that elicit skin conductance responses (SCRs) have been conceptualized in varied ways, with strong emphasis on the significance or arousing quality of stimuli. Our goal was to determine whether "significance" can be shown to have an effect on SCRs independent of "arousal," using words as stimuli. Ratings of words indicated that significance is partially independent of arousal. In Study 1, SCRs from 43 participants during presentation of 20 significant, nonarousing words with a negative valence that were either depression related or potentially self-referent and 20 nonsignificant words matched on valence and arousal showed a main effect of significance. In Study 2 (N=44), significant, nonarousing words were sampled more broadly to examine the effects of self-reference and valence. Significance, rather than just negativity or self-reference, elicited SCRs independently of arousal. SCRs to significant words may reflect cognitive and attentional processes that, in turn, might prove useful for the assessment of the cognitive aspects of anxiety.},

The only tasks that do not need attention appear to be carried out in the early stages of the visual system. Contrary to this common belief, we report that subjects can rapidly detect animals or vehicles in briefly presented novel natural scenes while simultaneously performing another attentionally demanding task. By comparison, they are unable to discriminate large T's from L's, or bisected two-color disks from their mirror images under the same conditions. We conclude that some visual tasks associated with "high-level" cortical areas may proceed in the near absence of attention.},

Often, visual awareness is equated to what is in the focus of attention. There are, however, two sets of arguments to separate attention from awareness: a psychological/theoretical one and a neurobiological one. By combining these arguments I present definitions of visual attention and awareness that clearly distinguish between the two, yet explain why attention and awareness are so intricately related. In fact, there seems more overlap between mechanisms of memory and awareness than between those of attention and awareness.},

abstract = {People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cul- tures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of indi- viduals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interde- pendence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motiva- tion; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion, and motivation.},

@article{Bower1981,
abstract = {This article describes experiments in which happy or sad moods were induced in subjects by hypnotic suggestion to investigate the influence of emotion on memory and thinking. One result was that subjects exhibited mood-state-dependent memory in recall of word lists, personal experiences recorded in a daily diary, and childhood experiences; people recalled a greater percentage of those experiences that were effectively congruent with the mood they were in during recall. Second, emotion powerfully influenced such cognitive processes as free associations, imaginative fantasies, social perceptions, and smap judgments about others' personalities (e.g., angry subjects generated angry associates, told hostile stories, and were prone to find fault with others). Third, when the feeling-time of a narrative agreed with the reader's emotion, the salience and memorability of events in that narrative were increased. Thus, sad readers attended more to sad material, identified with a sad character from a story, and recalled more about that character. An associative netowrk theory is proposed to account for these several results. In this theory, an emotion serves as a memory unit that can enter into associations with coincident events. Activation of this emotion unit aids retrieval of events associated with it; it also primes emotional themata for use in free association, fantasies, and perceptual categorization.},

White matter structure in a left temporo-parietal region that had been previously described as covarying with reading skill in adult readers also differs between children who are normal and poor readers. Specifically, the white matter structure measured using fractional anisotropy (FA) and coherence index (CI) significantly correlated with behavioral measurements of reading, spelling, and rapid naming performance. In general, lower anisotropy and lower coherence were associated with lower performance scores. Although the magnitude of the differences in children are smaller than those in adults, the results support the hypothesis that the structure of left temporoparietal neural pathways is a significant component of the neural system needed to develop fluent reading.},

However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology--a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

Although these are relevant to both sexes, it was found to be more acceptable for girls to work hard and still be part of the ?in crowd?, whilst boys were under greater pressure to conform to a ?cool?, masculine image, and were more likely to be ridiculed for working hard.

abstract = {This study investigated, first, the effect of stimulus frequency on mismatch negativity (MMN), N1, and P2 components of the cortical auditory event-related potential (ERP) evoked during passive listening to an oddball sequence. The hypothesis was that these components would show frequency-related changes, reflected in their latency and magnitude. Second, the effect of stimulus complexity on those same ERPs was investigated using words and consonant-vowel tokens (CVs) discriminated on the basis of formant change. Twelve normally hearing listeners were tested with tone bursts in the speech frequency range (400/440, 1,500/1,650, and 3,000/3,300 Hz), words (/baed/ vs /daed/) and CVs (/bae/ vs /dae/). N1 amplitude and latency decreased as frequency increased. P2 amplitude, but not latency, decreased as frequency increased. Frequency-related changes in MMN were similar to those for N1, resulting in a larger MMN area to low frequency contrasts. N1 amplitude and latency for speech sounds were similar to those found for low tones but MMN had a smaller area. Overall, MMN was present in 46{\%}-71{\%} of tests for tone contrasts but for only 25{\%}-32{\%} of speech contrasts. The magnitude of N1 and MMN for tones appear to be closely related, and both reflect the tonotopicity of the auditory cortex.},

The phonological and visuospatial subsystems have been extensively investigated, leading both to challenges over interpretation of individual phenomena and to more detailed attempts to model the processes underlying the subsystems. Analysis of the controlling central executive has proved more challenging, leading to a proposed clarification in which the executive is assumed to be a limited capacity attentional system, aided by a newly postulated fourth system, the episodic buffer. Current interest focuses most strongly on the link between working memory and long-term memory and on the processes allowing the integration of information from the component subsystems. The model has proved valuable in accounting for data from a wide range of participant groups under a rich array of task conditions. Working memory does still appear to be working.

We show that humans are competent optimizers on such tasks, adjusting their arrival times at a bus stop so as to minimize waiting time. Nonetheless, single males pursue a more risky strategy than single females by cutting waiting times much finer. Males are also more likely than females to cross busy roads when it is risky to do so. More importantly, males are more likely to initiate a crossing in high risk conditions when there are females present in the immediate vicinity, but females do not show a comparable effect in relation to the number of males present. These results support the suggestion that risk-taking is a form of "showing off" used as mate},

Questions about the neural bases of emotion regulation have recently taken on new importance, as functional imaging studies in humans have permitted direct investigation of control strategies that draw upon higher cognitive processes difficult to study in nonhumans. Such studies have examined (1) controlling attention to, and (2) cognitively changing the meaning of, emotionally evocative stimuli. These two forms of emotion regulation depend upon interactions between prefrontal and cingulate control systems and cortical and subcortical emotion-generative systems.

Higher levels of circulating testosterone were associated with lower risk aversion among women, but not among men. At comparably low concentrations of salivary testosterone, however, the gender difference in risk aversion disappeared, suggesting that testosterone has nonlinear effects on risk aversion regardless of gender. A similar relationship between risk aversion and testosterone was also found using markers of prenatal testosterone exposure. Finally, both testosterone levels and risk aversion predicted career choices after graduation: Individuals high in testosterone and low in risk aversion were more likely to choose risky careers in finance. These results suggest that testosterone has both organizational and activational effects on risk-sensitive financial decisions and long-term career choices.},

The test involved the recognition of correct translations, translations with semantic errors, and translations with syntactic errors from L1 to L2 and vice versa. As an overall result, both students and interpreters gave significantly more correct answers when sentences in L2 as the target language were sent to the left ear. Students recognized significantly more sentences containing syntactic errors than did professional interpreters, while professional interpreters recognized significantly more sentences with semantic errors than did interpreting students. In regard to hemispheric specialization in interpreting students, no significant asymmetries were revealed in the recognition of semantic and syntactic errors. Professional interpreters showed a significant right-ear superiority in recognizing semantic errors in L1 and a significant left-ear superiority in recognizing semantic errors in L2. In the recognition of syntactic errors, professional interpreters showed significant left-ear superiority for L1 and significant right-ear superiority for L2.

abstract = {Many forms of signal transduction occur when Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm of a cell. It has been generally thought that there is a fast buffer that rapidly reduces the free Ca2+ level and that it is this buffered level of Ca2+ that triggers downstream biochemical processes, notably the activation of calmodulin (CaM) and the resulting activation of CaM-dependent enzymes. Given the importance of these transduction processes, it is crucial to understand exactly how Ca2+ activates CaM. We have determined the rate at which Ca2+ binds to CaM and found that Ca 2+ binds more rapidly to CaM than to other Ca2+-binding proteins. This property of CaM and its high concentration support a new view of signal transduction: CaM directly intercepts incoming Ca2+ and sets the free Ca2+ level (that is, it strongly contributes to fast Ca 2+ buffering) rather than responding to the lower Ca2+ level set by other buffers. This property is crucial for making CaM an efficient transducer. Our results also suggest that other Ca2+ binding proteins have a previously undescribed role in regulating the lifetime of Ca2+ bound to CaM and thereby setting the gain of signal transduction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Fast real-time processing of external information by the brain is vital to survival in a highly dynamic environment. A ubiquitous information medium used by humans is spoken language, but the neural dynamics of its comprehension is still poorly understood. Here, we scrutinised the earliest electrophysiological activity elicited in the human brain by spoken words and matched meaningless word-like stimuli, using a lexical auditory oddball paradigm, an established technique for investigating cortical activation patterns underlying early automatic stages of language processing. We show that the earliest cortical reflection of word comprehension theoretically possible takes place during the electrophysiological P1 evoked response, already at about 30 ms following word disambiguation point and taking the form of an enhanced brain activation for familiar meaningful words, even when they are presented outside the focus of attention. This previously unknown ultra-early lexicality effect is underpinned by left temporo-frontal cortical circuits, and likely reflects a first-pass automatic lexical access, preceding later stages of lexical and semantic processing described previously. The results suggest that the brain operates with maximum speed and efficiency to extract linguistic information from the sensory input, a neurobiological capacity essential for timely and appropriate reactions to external events.},

@article{Payne2013,
abstract = {Combining high-density scalp EEG recordings with a sensitive analog measure of STM's fidelity, we characterized the temporal dynamics of intentional ignoring and related those dynamics to the intrusion of task-irrelevant information. On each trial of the task, two study Gabors were briefly presented in succession. A green or red disc preceding each Gabor signified whether that Gabor should be remembered or ignored, respectively. With cue-stimulus intervals of 300, 600, or 900 msec presented in separate sessions, we found that the onset of posterior, prestimulus alpha oscillations varied with the length of the interval. Although stimulus onset time was entirely predictable, the longer the cue-stimulus interval, the earlier the increase in prestimulus alpha power. However, the alpha-band modulation was not simply locked to the cue offset. The temporal envelopes of posterior alpha-band modulation were strikingly similar for both cued attending and cued ignoring and differed only in magnitude. This similarity suggests that cued attending includes suppression of task-irrelevant, spatial processing. Supporting the view that alpha-band oscillations represent inhibition, our graded measure of recall revealed that, when the stimulus to be ignored appears second in the sequence, peristimulus alpha power predicted the degree to which that irrelevant stimulus distorted subsequent recall of the stimulus that was to be remembered. These results demonstrate that timely deployment of attention-related alpha-band oscillations can aid STM by filtering out task-irrelevant information.},

Participants with more life event stress performed more poorly on Turner and Engle's (1989) operation-word span WM task, and this impairment was more pronounced on longer operations. Life event stress also predicted intrusion errors. Finally, self-reports of intrusive and avoidant thinking predicted functional WM capacity as did the recency of negative life events. The results are interpreted using a limited capacity model of WM in which cognitive representations of stressful life events compete with task demands for attentional resources.

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied successfully to brain decoding and image reconstruction from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. However, direct training of a DNN with fMRI data is often avoided because the size of available data is thought to be insufficient for training a complex network with numerous parameters. Instead, a pre-trained DNN usually serves as a proxy for hierarchical visual representations, and fMRI data are used to decode individual DNN features of a stimulus image using a simple linear model, which are then passed to a reconstruction module. Here, we directly trained a DNN model with fMRI data and the corresponding stimulus images to build an end-to-end reconstruction model. We accomplished this by training a generative adversarial network with an additional loss term that was defined in high-level feature space (feature loss) using up to 6,000 training data samples (natural images and fMRI responses). The above model was tested on independent datasets and directly reconstructed image using an fMRI pattern as the input. Reconstructions obtained from our proposed method resembled the test stimuli (natural and artificial images) and reconstruction accuracy increased as a function of training-data size. Ablation analyses indicated that the feature loss that we employed played a critical role in achieving accurate reconstruction. Our results show that the end-to-end model can learn a direct mapping between brain activity and perception.},

abstract = {Prior investigations of functional specialization have focused on the response profiles of particular brain regions. Given the growing emphasis on regional covariation, we propose to reframe these questions in terms of brain 'networks' (collections of regions jointly engaged by some mental process). Despite the challenges that investigations of the language network face, a network approach may prove useful in understanding the cognitive architecture of language. We propose that a language network plausibly includes a functionally specialized 'core' (brain regions that coactivate with each other during language processing) and a domain-general 'periphery' (a set of brain regions that may coactivate with the language core regions at some times but with other specialized systems at other times, depending on task demands). Framing the debate around network properties such as this may prove to be a more fruitful way to advance our understanding of the neurobiology of language. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@inproceedings{Gillespie1977,
abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

At an apperceptive level, finer grain distinctions may be made; the authors distinguished here between disorders of shape recognition and perceptual integration. It is not the case, however, that all patients with visual recognition deficits have impaired perception: poor recognition and naming may also result from damage to stored perceptual knowledge (eg, structural descriptions), from problems in accessing semantic knowledge, from perceptual knowledge, or from impairments to semantic knowledge itself. These represent different types of associative deficit. In some cases, mild damage to stored perceptual knowledge also generates problems that are more severe on naming than on recognition and more severe for some categories of objects than others.},

abstract = {We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural basis of extreme multilingual language control in a group of 50 multilingual participants. Comparing brain responses arising during simultaneous interpretation (SI) with those arising during simultaneous repetition revealed activation of regions known to be involved in speech perception and production, alongside a network incorporating the caudate nucleus that is known to be implicated in domain-general cognitive control. The similarity between the networks underlying bilingual language control and general executive control supports the notion that the frequently reported bilingual advantage on executive tasks stems from the day-to-day demands of language control in the multilingual brain. We examined neural correlates of the management of simultaneity by correlating brain activity during interpretation with the duration of simultaneous speaking and hearing. This analysis showed significant modulation of the putamen by the duration of simultaneity. Our findings suggest that, during SI, the caudate nucleus is implicated in the overarching selection and control of the lexico-semantic system, while the putamen is implicated in ongoing control of language output. These findings provide the first clear dissociation of specific dorsal striatum structures in polyglot language control, roles that are consistent with previously described involvement of these regions in nonlinguistic executive control.},

abstract = {The fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) have a long and intertwined history. In more recent times, however, communication and collaboration between the two fields has become less commonplace. In this article, we argue that better understanding biological brains could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. We survey historical interactions between the AI and neuroscience fields and emphasize current advances in AI that have been inspired by the study of neural computation in humans and other animals. We conclude by highlighting shared themes that may be key for advancing future research in both fields. Hassabis et al. review how neuroscience has informed research in artificial intelligence. They argue that a better understanding of biological brains will play a vital role in building intelligent machines.},

abstract = {Past work suggests that information related to the self receives 'preferential access' to the limited pool of attentional resources. However, these studies have been limited by their reliance on response-time measures, which require overt responding and represent the combined effects of multiple stages of information processing. One aim of the present study was to extend past work by obtaining a response-independent index of attention allocation sensitive to changes in discrete stages of information processing. An additional goal was to explore the potential time course of differential sensitivity to self-relevant cues. We assessed the P300, an ERP component that provides an index of attentional resources, evoked by autobiographical self-relevant stimuli (e.g., one's own name). As expected, P300 was augmented for self-relevant stimuli relative to control stimuli. In addition, analyses of P300 latency indicate that the effects of self-relevance are present during higher-order stages of cognitive processing related to selective attention. These results complement and extend previous work on the role of self-relevance in the selection of material for further processing. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 the authors. To go beyond qualitative models of the biological substrate of object recognition, we ask: can a single ventral stream neuronal linking hypothesis quantitatively account for core object recognition performance over a broad range of tasks? We measured human performance in 64 object recognition tests using thousands of challenging images that explore shape similarity and identity preserving object variation. We then used multielectrode arrays to measure neuronal population responses to those same images in visual areas V4 and inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys and simulated V1 population responses. We tested leading candidate linking hypotheses and control hypotheses, each postulating how ventral stream neuronal responses underlie object recognition behavior. Specifically, for each hypothesis, we computed the predicted performance on the 64 tests and compared it with the measured pattern of human performance. All tested hypotheses based on low- and mid-level visually evoked activity (pixels, V1, and V4) were very poor predictors of the human behavioral pattern. However, simple learned weighted sums of distributed average IT firing rates exactly predicted the behavioral pattern. More elaborate linking hypotheses relying on IT trial-by-trial correlational structure, finer IT temporal codes, or ones that strictly respect the known spatial substructures of IT (“face patches”) did not improve predictive power. Although these results do not reject those more elaborate hypotheses, they suggest a simple, sufficient quantitative model: each object recognition task is learned from the spatially distributed mean firing rates (100 ms) of{\~{}}60,000 IT neurons and is executed as a simple weighted sum of those firing rates.},

@article{Kerlin2010,
abstract = {Normal listeners possess the remarkable perceptual ability to select a single speech stream among many competing talkers. However, few studies of selective attention have addressed the unique nature of speech as a temporally extended and complex auditory object. We hypothesized that sustained selective attention to speech in a multitalker environment would act as gain control on the early auditory cortical representations of speech. Using high-density electroencephalography and a template-matching analysis method, we found selective gain to the continuous speech content of an attended talker, greatest at a frequency of 4-8 Hz, in auditory cortex. In addition, the difference in alpha power (8-12 Hz) at parietal sites across hemispheres indicated the direction of auditory attention to speech, as has been previously found in visual tasks. The strength of this hemispheric alpha lateralization, in turn, predicted an individual's attentional gain of the cortical speech signal. These results support a model of spatial speech stream segregation, mediated by a supramodal attention mechanism, enabling selection of the attended representation in auditory cortex.},

abstract = {Research on the neural basis of language processing has often avoided investigating spoken language production by fear of the electromyographic (EMG) artifacts that articulation induces on the electro-encephalogram (EEG) signal. Indeed, such articulation artifacts are typically much larger than the brain signal of interest. Recently, a Blind Source Separation technique based on Canonical Correlation Analysis was proposed to separate tonic muscle artifacts from continuous EEG recordings in epilepsy. In this paper, we show how the same algorithm can be adapted to remove the short EMG bursts due to articulation on every trial. Several analyses indicate that this method accurately attenuates the muscle contamination on the EEG recordings, providing to the neurolinguistic community a powerful tool to investigate the brain processes at play during overt language production.},

abstract = {Findings from single-cell recording studies suggest that a comparison of the outputs of different pools of selectively tuned lower-level sensory neurons may be a general mechanism by which higher-level brain regions compute perceptual decisions. For example, when monkeys must decide whether a noisy field of dots is moving upward or downward, a decision can be formed by computing the difference in responses between lower-level neurons sensitive to upward motion and those sensitive to downward motion. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging and a categorization task in which subjects decide whether an image presented is a face or a house to test whether a similar mechanism is also at work for more complex decisions in the human brain and, if so, where in the brain this computation might be performed. Activity within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is greater during easy decisions than during difficult decisions, covaries with the difference signal between face- and house-selective regions in the ventral temporal cortex, and predicts behavioural performance in the categorization task. These findings show that even for complex object categories, the comparison of the outputs of different pools of selectively tuned neurons could be a general mechanism by which the human brain computes perceptual decisions.},

The distinct contribution of different Ca(2+) clearance systems to Ca(2+) compartmentalization in dendritic spines versus shafts remains elusive. We applied a combination of ultrastructural and functional imaging methods to assess the subcellular distribution and role of NCX1 in rat CA1 pyramidal cells. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis of preembedding immunogold reactions revealed uniform densities of NCX1 along the shafts of apical and basal dendrites, but densities in dendritic shafts were approximately seven times higher than in dendritic spines. In line with these results, two-photon imaging of synaptically activated Ca(2+) transients during NCX blockade showed preferential action localized to the dendritic shafts for NCXs in regulating spine-dendrite coupling.},

abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

Simultaneous interpreting is an activity where people routinely comprehend and maintain speech while articulating at the same time. We examined whether AS also affects retention when, as in interpreting, coherent text is to be remembered or meaningful and phonologically more complex material is articulated. In the first part of the study, participants listened to a set of stories, and were involved in traditional or complex AS. Also coherence of the texts was manipulated. We found that the effects of AS generalises to stories, that coherence influences recall and that both variables interact. In the second part, we related individual differences in retention under conditions of AS to simultaneous interpreting performance. The results are discussed in terms of the episodic buffer component (e.g., Baddeley, 2000).},

abstract = {Studies of human auditory and somatosensory modalities have shown that there is an oscillatory response in the gamma-band (at about 40 Hz) frequency which is elicited by either steady state or transient stimulation. The auditory 40-Hz response is generated at least partially in the auditory cortex as a result of thalamocortical interaction and may serve perceptual integration and conscious perception. A connection to selective attention has been implied in human and animal studies, although the evidence is inconclusive. Moreover, fundamental differences between the human and animal 40-Hz responses prohibit generalization. Furthermore, most experiments have used steady-state stimulation during which the brain does not regain its resting state between stimuli as it does when transient stimulation is used. Here we study the effect of selective attention on the auditory gamma-band (40-Hz) transient response using subjects listening to tone pips presented in one ear while ignoring a concurrent sequence of tone pips in the other ear. The 40-Hz response was larger when subjects paid attention to stimuli rather than ignored them. This attention effect was most pronounced over the frontal and central scalp areas. Our results demonstrate a physiological correlate of selective attention in the 40-Hz transient response in humans.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Objective. People who suffer from hearing impairments can find it difficult to follow a conversation in a multi-speaker environment. Current hearing aids can suppress background noise; however, there is little that can be done to help a user attend to a single conversation amongst many without knowing which speaker the user is attending to. Cognitively controlled hearing aids that use auditory attention decoding (AAD) methods are the next step in offering help. Translating the successes in AAD research to real-world applications poses a number of challenges, including the lack of access to the clean sound sources in the environment with which to compare with the neural signals. We propose a novel framework that combines single-channel speech separation algorithms with AAD. Approach. We present an end-to-end system that (1) receives a single audio channel containing a mixture of speakers that is heard by a listener along with the listener's neural signals, (2) automatically separates the individual speakers in the mixture, (3) determines the attended speaker, and (4) amplifies the attended speaker's voice to assist the listener. Main results. Using invasive electrophysiology recordings, we identified the regions of the auditory cortex that contribute to AAD. Given appropriate electrode locations, our system is able to decode the attention of subjects and amplify the attended speaker using only the mixed audio. Our quality assessment of the modified audio demonstrates a significant improvement in both subjective and objective speech quality measures. Significance. Our novel framework for AAD bridges the gap between the most recent advancements in speech processing technologies and speech prosthesis research and moves us closer to the development of cognitively controlled hearable devices for the hearing impaired.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if working memory (WM) performance is significantly improved after the delivery of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), compared to an active comparator or sham. Methods: Ten participants undertook three experimental sessions in which they received 10. min of anodal tDCS (active comparator), tRNS or sham tDCS whilst performing the Sternberg WM task. Intra-stimulation engagement in a WM task was undertaken as this has been previously shown to enhance the effects of tDCS. Experimental sessions were separated by a minimum of 1. week. Immediately prior to and after each stimulation session the participants were measured on speed and accuracy of performance on an n-back task. Results: There was significant improvement in speed of performance following anodal tDCS on the 2-back WM task; this was the only significant finding. Conclusions: The results do not provide support for the hypothesis that tRNS improves WM. However, the study does provide confirmation of previous findings that anodal tDCS enhances some aspects of DLPFC functioning. Methodological limitations that may have contributed to the lack of significant findings following tRNS are discussed. Significance: Anodal tDCS may have significant implications for WM remediation in psychiatric conditions, particularly schizophrenia. ?? 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that individual differences in educational achievement are highly heritable throughout compulsory education. After completing compulsory education at age 16, students in England can choose to continue to study for two years (A-levels) in preparation for applying to university and they can freely choose which subjects to study. Here, for the first time, we show that choosing to do A-levels and the choice of subjects show substantial genetic influence, as does performance after two years studying the chosen subjects. Using a UK-representative sample of 6584 twin pairs, heritability estimates were 44{\%} for choosing to do A-levels and 52–80{\%} for choice of subject. Achievement after two years was also highly heritable (35–76{\%}). The findings that DNA differences substantially affect differences in appetites as well as aptitudes suggest a genetic way of thinking about education in which individuals actively create their own educational experiences in part based on their genetic propensities.},

abstract = {There has been a long history of research on visual working memory. Whereas early studies have focused on the role of lateral prefrontal cortex in the storage of sensory information, this has been challenged by research in humans that has directly assessed the encoding of perceptual contents, pointing towards a role of visual and parietal regions during storage. In a previous study we used pattern classification to investigate the storage of complex visual color patterns across delay periods. This revealed coding of such contents in early visual and parietal brain regions. Here we aim to investigate whether the involvement of visual and parietal cortex is also observable for other types of complex, visuo-spatial pattern stimuli. Specifically, we used a combination of fMRI and multivariate classification to investigate the retention of complex flow-field stimuli defined by the spatial patterning of motion trajectories of random dots. Subjects were trained to memorize the precise spatial layout of these stimuli and to retain this information during an extended delay. We used a multivariate decoding approach to identify brain regions where spatial patterns of activity encoded the memorized stimuli. Content-specific memory signals were observable in motion sensitive visual area MT+ and in posterior parietal cortex that might encode spatial information in a modality independent manner. Interestingly, we also found information about the memorized visual stimulus in somatosensory cortex, suggesting a potential crossmodal contribution to memory. Our findings thus indicate that working memory storage of visual percepts might be distributed across unimodal, multimodal and even crossmodal brain regions.},

abstract = {We review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that carry out different attentional functions. One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.},

Twelve normal hearing participants attended to one out of two simultaneously presented audiobook stories, while high density EEG was recorded. An offline iterative procedure eliminating those channels contributing the least to decoding provided insight into the necessary channel number and optimal cross-subject channel configuration. Aiming towards the future goal of near real-time classification with an individually trained decoder, the minimum duration of training data necessary for successful classification was determined by using a chronological cross-validation approach.

Furthermore, for less than 15 min of training data, the subject-independent (pre-trained) decoder performed better than an individually trained decoder did. Significance.

Preliminary findings show that L2 translation is a regular practice for more than 70{\%} of the full-time translators/interpreters in Croatia.

abstract = {This study examined development of pragmatic comprehension ability across time. Twenty native speakers and 92 Japanese college students of English completed a computerized listening task measuring ability to comprehend two types of implied meaning in dialogues: indirect refusals (k = 24) and indirect opinions (k 24). The participants' comprehension was analyzed for accuracy (scores on the listening task) and comprehension speed (average time taken to answer each item correctly). L2 learners accuracy and comprehension speed improved significantly over a 7-week period. However, the magnitude of effect was lower for comprehension speed than for accuracy. This study also examined the relationships among general L2 proficiency (measured on the ITP TOEFL), speed of lexical judgment (measured on a word recognition task), and pragmatic comprehension ability. There was a significant relationship between proficiency and accuracy (r = 0.39), as well as between lexical access speed and comprehension speed (r 0.40). However, L2 proficiency bore no relationship to comprehension speed, and lexical access speed had no relationship with accuracy. Moreover, accuracy and comprehension speed were not related to each other. These findings suggest that development of pragmatic knowledge and processing capacity of using the knowledge may not coincide perfectly in L2 development.},

@article{Scellier2016,
abstract = {This work follows Bengio and Fischer (2015) in which theoretical foundations were laid to show how iterative inference can backpropagate error signals. Neurons move their activations towards configurations corresponding to lower energy and smaller prediction error: a new observation creates a perturbation at visible neurons that propagates into hidden layers, with these propagated perturbations corresponding to the back-propagated gradient. This avoids the need for a lengthy relaxation in the positive phase of training (when both inputs and targets are observed), as was believed with previous work on fixed-point recurrent networks. We show experimentally that energy-based neural networks with several hidden layers can be trained at discriminative tasks by using iterative inference and an STDP-like learning rule. The main result of this paper is that we can train neural networks with 1, 2 and 3 hidden layers on the permutation-invariant MNIST task and get the training error down to 0.00{\%}. The results presented here make it more biologically plausible that a mechanism similar to back-propagation may take place in brains in order to achieve credit assignment in deep networks. The paper also discusses some of the remaining open problems to achieve a biologically plausible implementation of backprop in brains.},

abstract = {This study addresses for the first time on an experimental level the question of whether different modalities of conscious monitoring of attention (normal condition, attention focalization on the input, attention focalization on the output, condition with two voices) may affect the number and the type of mistakes made by simultaneous interpreters in different situations. The major results of the study are the following: (i) While the overall number of mistakes is influenced either by the translation direction, or by any of the four tested attention focalization modalities, a particular type of mistakes, i.e. those leading to loss of information, occur more often during active SI (from L1 into L2, i.e. from A to B) of difficult texts; (ii) during passive SI of difficult texts, missing information mistake are less frequent when interpreters listen to the incoming message with their left ear only; (iii) in active SI of difficult texts, attention should not be focussed on the incoming message in particular, so as to avoid so-called added mistakes. These results show that during simultaneous interpretation, conscious attention focalization on the input or on the output does not influence the interpreter{\&}apos;s overall performance, however with an important exception: during active interpretation it could be useful for interpreters to focus their attention on the output, since this may help them to reduce in particular false starts, pauses, hesitations, corrections, additions and morphosyntactic mistakes.},

abstract = {The modern study of perception began when Fechner published his ‘Elements of Psychophysics' in 1860. This book has guided most perception research ever since. It has become increasingly clear that there are problems with Fechner's approach, which assumes that the percept is completely determined by the sensory input. Fechner's approach cannot explain the processes that allow our percepts to be veridical. Post-Fechnerian schools (Helmholtzian, Structural, Gestalt and Gibsonian) have tried to deal with this problem, but have not been successful. An alternative to the Fechnerian approach is required. This paper describes an alternative that has been developing over the last 20 years within the computer vision community. It treats perceptual interpretation as a solution of an inverse problem that depends critically on the operation of a priori constraints. Contemporary research, which adopted this approach, has concentrated on verifying the usefulness of Bayesian and standard regularization methods. This paper takes the next step; it discusses theoretical and empirical aspects of studying human perception as an inverse problem. It reviews the literature that illustrates the power of the inverse problem approach. This review leads to the suggestion that progress in the study of perception will benefit if the inverse approach were to be adopted by experimentalists, as well as by the computational modelers, who have been actively exploring its potential to date.},

The studies demonstrate indicators forword-to-text integration and show differences in these indicators as a function of adult readingcomprehension skill. For skilled comprehenders, integration processes were reflected in N400indicators when a critical word had an explicit link to a word in the prior text and by both N400and P300 indicators when its meaning was a paraphrase of a prior word. When forward inferenceswere required for subsequent word-to-text integration, effects for skilled comprehenders were notreliable. Less skilled comprehenders showed delayed and less robust ERP effects, especially whenmeaning paraphrase was the basis of the integration.

abstract = {Persistent synapses are thought to underpin the storage of sensory experience, yet little is known about their structural plasticity in vivo. We investigated how persistent presynaptic structures respond to the loss of primary sensory input. Using in vivo two-photon (2P) imaging, we measured fluctuations in the size of excitatory axonal boutons in L2/3 of adult mouse visual cortex after monocular enucleation. The average size of boutons did not change after deprivation, but the range of bouton sizes was reduced. Large boutons decreased, and small boutons increased. Reduced bouton variance was accompanied by a reduced range of correlated calcium-mediated neural activity in L2/3 of awake animals. Network simulations predicted that size-dependent plasticity may promote conditions of greater bidirectional plasticity. These predictions were supported by electrophysiological measures of short- and long-term plasticity. We propose size-dependent dynamics facilitate cortical reorganization by maximizing the potential for bidirectional plasticity. Sammons et al. investigate the structural dynamics of persistent axonal boutons. Although central to many theories of sensory processing, persistent synapses remain understudied. Visual deprivation collapses the distribution of bouton sizes toward the mean. Bouton plasticity is accompanied by a reduced range of correlated network activity and greater bidirectional plasticity.},

Moreover, although human social decision making has been explored in a social psychology context, few neural explanations for the observed findings have been considered. To bridge this gap and improve models of human social decision making, we investigated whether acquiring a good reputation, which is an important incentive in human social behaviors, activates the same reward circuitry as monetary rewards. In total, 19 subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments involving monetary and social rewards. The acquisition of one's good reputation robustly activated reward-related brain areas, notably the striatum, and these overlapped with the areas activated by monetary rewards. Our findings support the idea of a "common neural currency" for rewards and represent an important first step toward a neural explanation for complex human social behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

When we hear the proverb 'Time flies like an arrow' we might ponder its meaning, but not the fact that there are almost 100 grammatically permissible interpretations of this short sentence. On occasion, however, we do notice sentential ambiguity: headlines, such as 'Two Sisters Reunited After 18 Years in Checkout Counter', are amusing because they so consistently lead to the unintended interpretation (presumably, the sisters did not spend 18 years at the checkout). It is this consistent preference for one interpretation - and one grammatical structure - rather than another that has fuelled research into sentence processing for more than 20 years. Until relatively recently, the dominant belief had been that these preferences arise from general principles that underlie our use of grammar, with certain grammatical constructions being preferred over others. There has now accrued, however, a considerable body of evidence demonstrating that these preferences are not absolute, but can change in particular circumstances. With this evidence have come new theories of sentence processing, some of which, at first glance, radically question the standard notions of linguistic representation, grammar and understanding.},

abstract = {Civil societies function because people pay taxes and make charitable contributions to provide public goods. One possible motive for charitable contributions, called "pure altruism," is satisfied by increases in the public good no matter the source or intent. Another possible motive, "warm glow," is only fulfilled by an individual's own voluntary donations. Consistent with pure altruism, we find that even mandatory, tax-like transfers to a charity elicit neural activity in areas linked to reward processing. Moreover, neural responses to the charity's financial gains predict voluntary giving. However, consistent with warm glow, neural activity further increases when people make transfers voluntarily. Both pure altruism and warm-glow motives appear to determine the hedonic consequences of financial transfers to the public good.},

abstract = {What are the consequences of calling things by their names? Six experiments investigated how classifying familiar objects with basic-level names (chairs, tables, and lamps) affected recognition memory. Memory was found to be worse for items that were overtly classified with the category name--as reflected by lower hit rates--compared with items that were not overtly classified. This effect of labeling on subsequent recall is explained in terms of a representational shift account, with labeling causing a distortion in dimensions most reliably associated with the category label. Consistent with this account, effects of labeling were strongly mediated by typicality and ambiguity of the labeled items, with typical and unambiguous items most affected by labeling. Follow-up experiments showed that this effect cannot be explained solely by differences in initial encoding, further suggesting that labeling a familiar image distorts its encoded representation. This account suggests a possible mechanism for the verbal overshadowing effect (J. W. Schooler {\&} T. Y. Engstler-Schooler, 1990).},

abstract = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

abstract = {Advances in molecular biology and neuroimaging have provided a unique opportunity to explore the relationships between genes, brain, and behavior. In this review, we will briefly outline the rationale for studying genetic effects on brain function with neuroimaging. We will then use studies of genetically driven variation in serotonin transporter function on corticolimbic structure and function to highlight the effectiveness of this strategy to delineate biological pathways and mechanisms by which individual differences in brain function emerge and potentially bias behavior and risk for psychiatric illness. In a series of studies, a relatively frequent regulatory variant of the human serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has been demonstrated to bias the reactivity of the amygdala to salient environmental cues. Moreover, the 5-HTTLPR affects the development of a broader corticolimbic circuit and alters the functional integration of emotional information between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. In turn, corticolimbic circuit function predicts individual differences in an experimental index of temperamental anxiety and, thus, might reflect a predictive biological marker of increased risk for mood disorders associated with the 5-HTTLPR. ?? 2006 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

It discusses prosody with particular reference to its tonal, durational and dynamic features, such as intonation, pauses, rhythm and accent, as well as its main functions, i.e. structure and prominence. Following a review of previous studies on the topic, a conceptual approach for the analysis of prosody in terms of structure and prominence is developed and subsequently applied to an authentic corpus of professional simultaneous interpretation consisting of three German versions of a 72-minute English source text. Prosodic patterns in the corpus are analyzed by means of a computer-aided method using the software PRAAT. The findings confirm that prosodic features are interdependent and that those in the target texts show certain characteristics that are specific to simultaneous interpreting.},

abstract = {A growing body of research suggests that the predictive power of working memory (WM) capacity for measures of intellectual aptitude is due to the ability to control attention and select relevant information. Crucially, attentional mechanisms implicated in controlling access to WM are assumed to be domain-general, yet reports of enhanced attentional abilities in individuals with larger WM capacities are primarily within the visual domain. Here, we directly test the link between WM capacity and early attentional gating across sensory domains, hypothesizing that measures of visual WM capacity should predict an individual's capacity to allocate auditory selective attention. To address this question, auditory ERPs were recorded in a linguistic dichotic listening task, and individual differences in ERP modulations by attention were correlated with estimates of WM capacity obtained in a separate visual change detection task. Auditory selective attention enhanced ERP amplitudes at an early latency (ca. 70–90 msec), with larger P1 components elicited by linguistic probes embedded in an attended narrative. Moreover, this effect was associated with greater individual estimates of visual WM capacity. These findings support the view that domain-general attentional control mechanisms underlie the wide variation of WM capacity across individuals.},

abstract = {In this paper we suggest that the cognitive mechanism of suppression attenuates interference in many language comprehension phenomena, and is particularly crucial when comprehension must share processing capacity with other cognitive tasks, as is manifestly the case in simultaneous interpreting. During lexical access, the mechanism of suppression attenuates the interference caused by the activation of other lexical information, such as the inappropriate meanings of homonyms. During anaphoric reference, the mechanism of suppression attenuates the interference caused by the activation of other potential referents. In this way, the referent to which the anaphor does refer becomes the most activated concept. During syntactic parsing, the mechanism of suppression attenuates the interference caused by a previous syntactic form. During metaphor comprehension, the mechanism of suppression attenuates the interference caused by a literal interpretation. During inferencing, the mechanism of suppression attenuates the interference caused by an initial but inappropriate inference. We propose therefore that suppression a general, cognitive mechanism that attenuates interference plays a crucial role in language comprehension and simultaneous interpretation.},

abstract = {Studies of working memory load effects on human EEG power have indicated divergent effects in different frequency bands. Although gamma power typically increases with load, the load dependency of the lower frequency theta and alpha bands is uncertain. We obtained intracranial electroencephalography measurements from 1453 electrode sites in 14 epilepsy patients performing a Sternberg task, in order to characterize the anatomical distribution of load-related changes across the frequency spectrum. Gamma power increases occurred throughout the brain, but were most common in the occipital lobe. In the theta and alpha bands, both increases and decreases were observed, but with different anatomical distributions. Increases in theta and alpha power were most prevalent in frontal midline cortex. Decreases were most commonly observed in occipital cortex, colocalized with increases in the gamma range, but were also detected in lateral frontal and parietal regions. Spatial overlap with group functional magnetic resonance imaging results was minimal except in the precentral gyrus. These findings suggest that power in any given frequency band is not a unitary phenomenon; rather, reactivity in the same frequency band varies in different brain regions, and may relate to the engagement or inhibition of a given area in a cognitive task.},

The focus of attention presumably can link activated elements to form new chunks of information. Several basic phenomena are sketched out, along with their potential relevance for the process of simultaneous interpreting. Current controversies that are likely to be of relevance to interpreting also are discussed.

abstract = {The properties of linguistic attention were examined by recording event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to probe stimuli mixed with dichotically presented prose passages. Subjects either shadowed (repeated phrase by phrase) or selectively listened to one passage while ERPs were recorded from electrodes overlying midline sites, left-hemisphere speech areas, and corresponding areas of the right hemisphere. Mixed with each voice (a male voice in one ear, a female voice in the other) were four probe stimuli: digitized speech sounds (but or /a/ as in father) produced by the same speaker and tone bursts at the mean fundamental and second formant frequencies of that voice. The ERPs elicited by the speech probes in the attended ear showed an enhanced negativity, with an onset at 50 ms-100 ms and lasting up to 800 ms-1,000 ms, whereas the ERPs to the second formant probes showed an enhanced positivity in the 200 ms-300 ms latency range. These effects were comparable for shadowing and selective listening conditions and remained stable over the course of the experiment. The attention-related negativity to the consonant-vowel-consonant probe (but) was most prominent over the left hemisphere; other probes produced no significant asymmetries. The results indicate that stimulus selection during linguistic attention is specifically tuned to speech sounds rather than simply to constituent pure-tone frequencies or ear of entry. Furthermore, it appears that both attentional set and stimulus characteristics can influence the hemispheric utilization of stimuli.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging research on the brain basis of memory decline in older adults typically has examined age-related changes either in structure or in function. Structural imaging studies have found that smaller medial temporal lobe (MTL) volumes are associated with lower memory performance. Functional imaging studies have found that older adults often exhibit bilateral frontal-lobe activation under conditions where young adults exhibit unilateral frontal activation. As yet, no one has examined whether these MTL structural and frontal-lobe functional findings are associated. In this study, we tested whether these findings were correlated in a population of healthy older adults in whom we previously demonstrated verbal memory performance was positively associated with left entorhinal cortex volume in the MTL (Rosen et al., 2003) and right frontal lobe activation during memory encoding (Rosen et al., 2002). Thirteen, non-demented, community-dwelling older adults participated both in a functional MRI (fMRI) study of verbal memory encoding and structural imaging. MRI-derived left entorhinal volume was measured on structural images and entered as a regressor against fMRI activation during verbal memory encoding. Right frontal activation (Brodmann's Area 47/insula) was positively correlated with left entorhinal cortex volume. These findings indicate a positive association between MTL volume and right frontal-lobe function that may underlie variability in memory performance among the elderly, and also suggest a two-stage model of memory decline in aging.},

abstract = {We have studied the effect of selective listening on the neuromagnetic evoked activity of the human auditory cortex. In the word categorization experiment the stimuli were 5-letter words, each beginning with (k). Half of them were targets, i.e., names of animals or plants, and half other meaningful Finnish words. In the duration discrimination experiment equiprobable tones of 425 ms (targets) or 600 ms duration were presented. In both experiments the interstimulus interval (ISI) was 2.3 s and the stimuli of the two classes were presented randomly. Subjects either ignored the stimuli (reading condition) or counted the number of targets (listening condition). The magnetic field over the head was measured with a 7-channel 1st-order SQUID-gradiometer. The stimuli evoked a transient response followed by a sustained field. The transient response did not differ between the two conditions but the sustained field was significantly larger in the listening than reading condition; the increase began 120-200 ms after stimulus onset and continued for several hundred milliseconds. The equivalent source locations of both transient and sustained responses agreed with activation of the supratemporal auditory cortex. In the dichotic listening experiment 25-ms square-wave stimuli were presented randomly and equiprobably either to the left or to the right ear at an ISI of 0.8-1 s, either alone or in presence of a speech masker. Counting the stimuli of either ear resulted in differences between responses to relevant and irrelevant sounds. The difference began 140-150 ms after stimulus onset and peaked at 200-240 ms. During monaural speech masking, N100m was larger for attended than ignored stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Simultaneous interpreters, bilinguals without any training in simultaneous interpreting, and control monolinguals performed the Wisconsin card sorting task (WCST; Experiment 1) and the Simon task (Experiment 2). Performance on WCST was thought to index cognitive flexibility while Simon task performance was considered an index of inhibitory processes. Simultaneous interpreters outperformed bilinguals and monolinguals on the WCST by showing reduced number of attempts to infer the rule, few errors, and few previous-category perseverations. However, simultaneous interpreters presented Simon effects similar to those found in bilinguals and monolinguals. Together, these results suggest that experience in interpreting is associated with changes in control processes required to perform interpreting tasks.},

The test involved the recognition of correct translations, translations with semantic errors, and translations with syntactic errors from L1 to L2 and vice versa. As an overall result, both students and interpreters gave significantly more correct answers when sentences in L2 as the target language were sent to the left ear. Students recognized significantly more sentences containing syntactic errors than did professional interpreters, while professional interpreters recognized significantly more sentences with semantic errors than did interpreting students. In regard to hemispheric specialization in interpreting students, no significant asymmetries were revealed in the recognition of semantic and syntactic errors. Professional interpreters showed a significant right-ear superiority in recognizing semantic errors in L1 and a significant left-ear superiority in recognizing semantic errors in L2. In the recognition of syntactic errors, professional interpreters showed significant left-ear superiority for L1 and significant right-ear superiority for L2. The prolonged practice in simultaneous interpreting strategies in EEC professional interpreters may account for some of their peculiar hemispheric specializations for languages revealed by this study.},

While subjects maintained central eye fixation, ERPs were recorded to words presented to the left and right visual fields. In each of 6 runs, subjects focussed attention to alternate fields to perform a category-detection task. Pairs of semantically related and repeated words were embedded in the word lists presented to the attended and unattended visual fields. Consistent with prior studies, the P1-N1 visual ERP was larger when elicited by words in attended spatial locations. A large negative slow wave identified as N400 was elicited by attended, but not unattended, words. For attended words, N400 was smaller for semantically primed or repeated words. We concluded that spatial selective attention can modulate the degree to which words are processed, and that the cognitive processes associated with N400 are not automatic.},

Yet, evidence that rodent visual cortex is capable of advanced visual processing, such as object recognition, is limited. Here we investigate how neurons located along the progression of extrastriate areas that, in the rat brain, run laterally to primary visual cortex, encode object information. We found a progressive functional specialization of neural responses along these areas, with: (1) a sharp reduction of the amount of low-level, energy-related visual information encoded by neuronal firing; and (2) a substantial increase in the ability of both single neurons and neuronal populations to support discrimination of visual objects under identity-preserving transformations (e.g., position and size changes). These findings strongly argue for the existence of a rat object-processing pathway, and point to the rodents as promising models to dissect the neuronal circuitry underlying transformation-tolerant recognition of visual objects.},

By reducing the complexity of the brain to achievable target questions, such in vitro bioassays better control experimental variables and can serve as a versatile tool for fundamental and pharmacological research. Astrocytes are a cell type critical to neuronal function, and the addition of astrocytes to neuron cultures can improve the quality of in vitro assays. Here, we present cellulose as an astrocyte culture substrate. Astrocytes cultured on the cellulose fiber matrix thrived and formed a dense 3D network. We devised a novel co-culture platform by suspending the easy-to-handle astrocytic paper cultures above neuronal networks of low densities typically needed for bottom-up neuroscience. There was drastic improvement in neuronal viability after 5 days in vitro at densities ranging from 50,000 cells/cm2 down to isolated cells at 1,000 cells/cm2. Cultures exhibited spontaneous spiking even at the very low densities, with a significantly greater spike frequency per cell compared to control mono-cultures. Applying the co-culture platform to an engineered network of neurons on a patterned substrate resulted in significantly improved viability and almost doubled the density of live cells. Lastly, the shape of the cellulose substrate can easily be customized to a wide range of culture vessels, making the platform versatile for different applications that will further enable research in bottom-up neuroscience and drug development.},

Research involving EDA has been reported in practically all psychology, psychiatry, and psychophysiology research journals. The wide range of journals in which EDA research is published reflects the fact that EDA measures have been applied to a wide variety of questions ranging from basic research examining attention, information processing, and emotion, to more applied clinical research examining predictors and/or correlates of normal and abnormal behavior. The application ofEDAmeasures to a wide variety of issues is due in large part to its relative ease of measurement and quantification combined with its sensitivity to psychological states and processes. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a tutorial overview of EDA for interested students, researchers, and practitioners who are not specialists in this particular system.

@article{Almairac2015,
abstract = {Consequential works in cognitive neuroscience have led to the formulation of an interactive dual-stream model of language processing: the dorsal stream may process the phonological aspects of language, whereas the ventral stream may process the semantic aspects of language. While it is well-accepted that the dorsal route is subserved by the arcuate fasciculus, the structural connectivity of the semantic ventral stream is a matter of dispute. Here we designed a longitudinal study to gain new insights into this central but controversial question. Thirty-one patients harboring a left diffuse low-grade glioma—a rare neurological condition that infiltrates preferentially white matter associative pathways—were assessed with a prototypical task of language (i.e. verbal fluency) before and after surgery. All were operated under local anesthesia with a cortical and subcortical brain mapping—enabling to identify and preserve eloquent structures for language. We performed voxel-based lesion-symptom (VLSM) analyses on pre- and postoperative behavioral data. Preoperatively, we found a significant relationship between semantic fluency scores and the white matter fibers shaping the ventro-lateral connectivity (P {\textless} 0.05 corrected). The statistical map was found to substantially overlap with the spatial position of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) (37.7{\%}). Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between semantic fluency scores and the infiltration volumes in this fasciculus (r = -0.4, P = 0.029). Postoperatively, VLSM analyses were inconclusive. Taken as a whole and when combined with the literature data, our findings strengthen the view that the IFOF plays an essential role in semantic processing and may subserve the direct ventral pathway of language.},

abstract = {Attempts to understand visual attention producing models based on location, in which attention selects particular regions of space, and models based on other visual attributes (e.g., in which attention selects discrete objects or specific features). Previous studies of inattentional blindness have contributed to our understanding of attention by suggesting that the detection of an unexpected object depends on the distance of that object from the spatial focus of attention. When the distance of a briefly flashed object from both fixation and the focus of attention is systematically varied, detection appears to have a location-based component. However, the likelihood that people will detect an unexpected event in sustained and dynamic displays may depend on more than just spatial location. The authors investigated the influence of spatial location on inattentional blindness under precisely controlled, sustained and dynamic conditions, using a sample of 143 observers (mean age 20.4 yrs). They found that although location-based models cannot fully account for the detection of unexpected objects, spatial location does play a role even when displays are visible for an extended period.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aim to extract and denoise the attended speaker in a noisy, two-speaker acoustic scenario, relying on microphone array recordings from a binaural hearing aid, which are complemented with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to infer the speaker of interest. METHODS: In this study, we propose a modular processing flow that first extracts the two speech envelopes from the microphone recordings, then selects the attended speech envelope based on the EEG, and finally uses this envelope to inform a multi-channel speech separation and denoising algorithm. RESULTS: Strong suppression of interfering (unattended) speech and background noise is achieved, while the attended speech is preserved. Furthermore, EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) is shown to be robust to the use of noisy speech signals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that AAD-based speaker extraction from microphone array recordings is feasible and robust, even in noisy acoustic environments, and without access to the clean speech signals to perform EEG-based AAD. SIGNIFICANCE: Current research on AAD always assumes the availability of the clean speech signals, which limits the applicability in real settings. We have extended this research to detect the attended speaker even when only microphone recordings with noisy speech mixtures are available. This is an enabling ingredient for new brain-computer interfaces and effective filtering schemes in neuro-steered hearing prostheses. Here, we provide a first proof of concept for EEG-informed attended speaker extraction and denoising.},

abstract = {One of the long-standing debates in studies on simultaneous interpreting would pit contextualists, who see interpreters performances as being conditioned by contextual determinants, against cognitivists, who analyze performances in terms of cognitive constraints that would be the same for all professionals, regardless of context. Giles Effort Models would seem to be very much in the cognitive camp. However, modeling of the resources used when interpreters make omissions suggests that cognitive management may actively respond to contextual factors such as the aims of the discourse, the strategies of the speakers, and the variable risks of the text items. Analysis of the data from one of Giles experiments indicates that the cognitive management of omissions is indeed highly variable. Omissions that are low-risk for the aims of the discourse occur in a constant background mode, almost without source-text stimuli, such that they are found in repeat performances with similar frequency but in different places. On the other hand, omissions that incur high levels of risk tend to be repaired in repeat performance. This suggests that simultaneous interpreters strive for non-omission only in the case of high-risk contextualization. Further, since their management skills must incorporate enough contextualization for the necessary risk analysis to take place, the cognitive strategies of interpreters should be modeled in the same terms as those of all other linguistic mediators.},

Here we investigated by immunocytochemistry the cellular and subcellular localization of the three known NCX isoforms, NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3, in adult rat neocortex and hippocampus. NCX1-3 were widely expressed in both brain areas: NCX1 immunoreactivity (ir) was exclusively associated to neuropilar puncta, while NCX2-3 were also detected in neuronal somata and dendrites. NCX1-3 ir was often identified around blood vessels. In both neocortex and hippocampus, all NCX isoforms were prominently expressed in dendrites and dendritic spines contacted by asymmetric axon terminals, whereas they were poorly expressed in presynaptic boutons. In addition, NCX1-3 ir was detected in astrocytes, notably in distal processes ensheathing excitatory synapses. All NCXs were expressed in perivascular astrocytic endfeet and endothelial cells. The robust expression of NCX1-3 in heterogeneous cell types in the brain in situ emphasizes their role in handling Ca2+ and Na+ in both excitable and non-excitable cells. Perisynaptic localization of NCX1-3 in dendrites and spines indicates that all isoforms are favourably located for buffering [Ca2+]i in excitatory postsynaptic sites. NCX1-3 expressed in perisynaptic glial processes may participate in shaping astrocytic [Ca2+]i transients evoked by ongoing synaptic activity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
